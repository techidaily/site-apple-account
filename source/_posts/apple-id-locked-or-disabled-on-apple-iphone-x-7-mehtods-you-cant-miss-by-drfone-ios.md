## Apple ID Locked or Disabled On Apple iPhone X? 7 Mehtods You Can't-Miss

Apple ID refers to the authentication method available for the Apple iPhone X device to compromise users' personal information and settings. The Apple iPhone X Apple ID will allow you to store and control data available on the Apple iPhone X device; however, you need to re-generate the Apple iPhone X passcode if you have forgotten the Apple iPhone X passcode. Suppose, if you have forgotten the passcode and entered the wrong passcode six times, your Apple iPhone X gets locked or has been disabled. According to your settings, if you have entered the wrong passcode too much time could even make your Apple iPhone X delete all the data available.

This article will discuss how you can **unlock Apple ID** and remain secure. If you receive a message that you have entered the wrong passcode or forgotten your passcode, you have to follow some steps to regain access to your Apple Id.

## Why Is Your Apple ID Locked or Disabled?

![apple id locked](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/03/apple-id-locked.png)

Some of the reasons causing your Apple ID locked or disabled are listed below:

- If you have entered the wrong passcode or security question too many times in a row, Apple ID gets locked. (Avoid entering the incorrect password more than 3 times)
- If you haven't used your Apple ID for an extended period, possibly making your Apple ID disabled or locked. When Apple modifies the requirement for passcode and security questions, you have not updated the information.

If you frequently change your Apple ID or passcode on the Apple iPhone X device, Apple possibly considers that your Apple iPhone X faces a security threat and might lock your Apple ID.

- Step 2: Enable the Recovery Mode on Your Apple iPhone X

Once the Apple iPhone X is connected, hit “Unlock Now” and proceed to confirm that your device has a screen lock configured and 2FA is enabled. These are necessary for the removal of Apple ID, so set them up if you haven't already. Afterward, activate Recovery Mode following the on-screen instructions on your device.

- Step 3: Unlock the Apple ID From Your Apple iPhone X

As your device is in Recovery Mode, Dr.Fone will detect its model. You need to choose the system version and click “Start” to download it. Once it has been downloaded and verified, hit “Unlock Now.” A warning prompt will appear about expected data loss. Put the “000000” PIN in the warning box and click “Unlock.” This will start the Apple ID unlock process.
