- **Step 3: Connect the iOS Device**

Connect the iOS device to the computer using its lightning cable. Then enter the Apple iPhone XR device’s passcode and, when prompted, tap “Trust” to allow the computer to detect the Apple iPhone XR device. The program should detect the Apple iPhone XR device and display information about it. Then click “Unlock Now”.
