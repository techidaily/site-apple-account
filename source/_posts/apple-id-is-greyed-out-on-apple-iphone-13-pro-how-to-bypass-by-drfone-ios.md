## Part 3. What does it influence when “Your account has been disabled in the App Store and iTunes”?

When you see the error message “Your account has been disabled in the App Store and iTunes” it often means the following:

- You cannot access Apple Books, App Store purchases, and even iTunes purchases.

- Furthermore, you may not be able to access Apple services and any Apple Store orders and repairs may need to be rescheduled.
