If you've lost your Apple ID and need to find it on your Windows device, follow these steps:

- **Step 1:** If you're using a Windows PC, launch iCloud on your PC. Syncing your Apple device (such as an iPhone or iPad) to your computer is probably why you installed this.

**Note:** You can use iTunes instead of iCloud if you don't have one on your Windows PC yet.
