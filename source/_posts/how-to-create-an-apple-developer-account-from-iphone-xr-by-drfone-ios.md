Apple users can attach the AirTag to different objects like backpacks or keychains. This makes it simple to find these objects later in case they get misplaced or lost through the Find My app on the iPhone.

Users can add their AirTag to one Apple ID account, so you cannot access this from the Find My app via other accounts. In case of loss, you must remove the AirTag from your device entirely.
