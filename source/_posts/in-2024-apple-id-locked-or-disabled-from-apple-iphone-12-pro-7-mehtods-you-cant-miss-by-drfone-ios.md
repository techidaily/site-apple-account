## Apple ID Locked or Disabled On Apple iPhone 12 Pro? 7 Mehtods You Can't-Miss

### 4\. Software Glitches or Bugs

Software inconsistencies within the Apple iPhone 12 Pro device's operating system can lead to temporary malfunctions. That results in the greying out of the Apple ID. Such glitches can arise due to software updates or incomplete installations. It can also happen due to conflicts between different applications.

### 5\. Apple Server Maintenance or Outage

Periodic maintenance or unexpected server outages on Apple's end can disrupt the functionality of the Apple ID. As a result, you experience temporary Apple ID grey-out issues. During such occurrences, users may experience difficulties accessing their Apple ID.
