### On Windows PC

If you've lost your Apple ID and need to find it on your Windows device, follow these steps:

- **Step 1:** If you're using a Windows PC, launch iCloud on your PC. Syncing your Apple device (such as an iPhone or iPad) to your computer is probably why you installed this.

**Note:** You can use iTunes instead of iCloud if you don't have one on your Windows PC yet.

![icloud apple id settings](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/11/finding-your-apple-id-08.jpg)

- **Step 2:** And that's it! Your Apple ID should be there. Your Apple ID will be associated with your name as long as you are logged in.

**Why It's Important**

Even on a Windows PC, your Apple ID is your gateway to Apple services, which means you can access your iCloud data and enjoy Apple Music and the iTunes Store.

### Remember Knowing Your Apple ID Is Crucial

Your Apple ID is the key to a world of apps, services, and secure data. Knowing how to find it on your device is the first step in making the most of your Apple experience. So, take a moment to discover your Apple ID on your Apple iPhone 13 mini, iPad, Mac, or Windows PC. It's a small effort that brings you big benefits!
