## Part 5. FAQs about Apple ID Phone Number

1. **How to Add a Trusted Phone Number to Your Apple ID?**

The steps for adding the trusted phone number to Apple ID are accessible through Settings > Apple ID icon/name > Password & Security > Edit icon beside the phone number already in use. Click on the "Add a trusted phone number" option and insert the new one. Confirm with your device passcode at the end.

2. **Why Isn't My Apple ID Accepting My Apple iPhone 15 Pro Number?**

Apple ID accepts phone numbers for linking for two-factor authentication. The local number in the region is needed for pairing the number and Apple ID.

3. **Does Changing Apple ID affect Phone Number?**

No, the Apple ID and phone number are not connected as features or codes. So, adjusting the Apple ID will not affect your device's phone number.

### Conclusion

Indeed, there are multiple methods you can take to remove the phone number registered to your Apple ID successfully. They are accessible in multiple ways through Mac, iPad, or iPhone settings. If you forgot the Apple ID, you could even remove it using [Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/iphone-unlock/). Ultimately, choose the process to trust based on your specific needs.
