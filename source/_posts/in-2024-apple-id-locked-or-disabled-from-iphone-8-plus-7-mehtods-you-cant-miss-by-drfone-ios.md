## Apple ID Locked or Disabled On Apple iPhone 8 Plus? 7 Mehtods You Can't-Miss

Suppose, if you have forgotten the passcode and entered the wrong passcode six times, your Apple iPhone 8 Plus gets locked or has been disabled. According to your settings, if you have entered the wrong passcode too much time could even make your Apple iPhone 8 Plus delete all the data available.

This article will discuss how you can **unlock Apple ID** and remain secure. If you receive a message that you have entered the wrong passcode or forgotten your passcode, you have to follow some steps to regain access to your Apple Id.
