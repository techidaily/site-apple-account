## Part 4: Erase an iPhone Without Apple ID via Activation Lock Support Request

You can request to unlock Activation Lock support from Apple if your device is not in Lost Mode or if you need to **erase an iPhone without an** Apple ID password. To do this, you need to provide proof of purchase of the iPhone. It can be in the form of a receipt, invoice, or credit card statement.

The proof should show the serial number of the iPhone, [<u>IMEI</u>](https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/unlock-phone-free-with-imei-number.html), or MEID. Once Apple unlocks the Activation Lock on your Apple iPhone 6, your Apple iPhone 6 contents will be permanently erased. Also, note that if you restore your Apple iPhone 6 from a local backup, the Activation Lock will re-enable.

To start this request, follow these steps:

- **Step 1:** Head to Apple's Activation Lock support page. (al-support.apple.com)
- **Step 2:** Scroll down the page, select the agreement checkbox, click **Continue**, and it will redirect you to a new page.
