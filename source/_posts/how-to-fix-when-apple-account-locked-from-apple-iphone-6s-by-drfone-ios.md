To summarize, we've navigated the complex world of how to **change the credit card on Apple** account. We've explored two critical aspects: changing the credit card on your Apple ID and altering the default credit card on Apple Pay. It's important to understand that your credit card details for Apple ID and Apple Pay are distinct. Thus, it's crucial to know how to update both to ensure a secure digital experience.

We explored many methods to **change the credit card on Apple ID** and Apple Pay, depending on your device and preference. Furthermore, there are unfortunate instances where you find yourself locked out of your Apple ID. For these, we introduced a valuable tool: Wondershare Dr.Fone - iOS Screen Unlock. This tool can efficiently unlock your Apple ID without causing any data loss, ensuring you can regain access to your account promptly.
