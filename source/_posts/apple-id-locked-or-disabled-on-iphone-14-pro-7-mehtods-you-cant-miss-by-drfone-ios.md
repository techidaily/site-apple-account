According to your settings, if you have entered the wrong passcode too much time could even make your Apple iPhone 14 Pro delete all the data available.

This article will discuss how you can **unlock Apple ID** and remain secure. If you receive a message that you have entered the wrong passcode or forgotten your passcode, you have to follow some steps to regain access to your Apple Id.

## Why Is Your Apple ID Locked or Disabled?

![apple id locked](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/03/apple-id-locked.png)

Some of the reasons causing your Apple ID locked or disabled are listed below:

- If you have entered the wrong passcode or security question too many times in a row, Apple ID gets locked. (Avoid entering the incorrect password more than 3 times)
- If you haven't used your Apple ID for an extended period, possibly making your Apple ID disabled or locked. When Apple modifies the requirement for passcode and security questions, you have not updated the information.

If you frequently change your Apple ID or passcode on the Apple iPhone 14 Pro device, Apple possibly considers that your Apple iPhone 14 Pro faces a security threat and might lock your Apple ID.
