**Step 1:** Go to the [Apple ID Account Page](https://appleid.apple.com/) and click “**Forgot Apple ID or Password**”.

**Step 2:** Enter your Apple ID and click “**Continue**”. In the next window, select “**I Need to Reset My Password**”.

**Step 3:** Now, select the method using which you want to reset the password. Here are the three possible options.

- If you’ve set up security questions while creating your Apple ID, you can choose “**Answer Security Questions**”. This method will only work if you remember all the answers to every security question. Once you select this method, you’ll be prompted to a new window, with all security questions. Answer these questions and follow the further instructions to reset your password.
- If you’ve added a recovery e-mail while creating your Apple ID, you can also use it to reset the password. In this case, select “**Get an E-mail**”. You’ll receive a password reset e-mail on your registered email.
