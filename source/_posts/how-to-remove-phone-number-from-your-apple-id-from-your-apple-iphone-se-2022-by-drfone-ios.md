**Step 2:** Enter your Apple ID and click “**Continue**”. In the next window, select “**I Need to Reset My Password**”.

**Step 3:** Now, select the method using which you want to reset the password. Here are the three possible options.

- If you’ve set up security questions while creating your Apple ID, you can choose “**Answer Security Questions**”. This method will only work if you remember all the answers to every security question. Once you select this method, you’ll be prompted to a new window, with all security questions. Answer these questions and follow the further instructions to reset your password.
- If you’ve added a recovery e-mail while creating your Apple ID, you can also use it to reset the password. In this case, select “**Get an E-mail**”. You’ll receive a password reset e-mail on your registered email.

- Whichever recovery method you choose, make sure to follow the on-screen instructions carefully. Once your password reset process completes, you’ll have to individually update the password in every iCloud service, be it iTunes or iMessage.

In case you have enabled two-way verification on your Apple iPhone SE (2022), you’ll receive a different screen after clicking “Forgot Apple ID or Password”. In this case, you’ll have to follow a different approach to reset your Apple ID password.

**Step 1:** Go to the Apple ID Account page and click “**Forgot ID or Password**”.

**Step 2:** Enter your Apple ID and select the “**Reset Password**” option.

**Step 3:** In the next window, you’ll be asked to enter the “**Recovery Key**”. This is a unique key that is provided when a user enables two-way verification for their iCloud account. Enter the recovery key and click “**Continue**”.
