![remove airtag on iphone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/01/how-to-remove-airtag-from-apple-id-1.jpg)

Before discussing **how to remove AirTag from Apple ID,** you should know better about the function itself. The AirTag feature is available for iOS devices. Therefore, one can register the AirTag process with the Apple ID you are utilizing on your smartphone.

Apple users can attach the AirTag to different objects like backpacks or keychains. This makes it simple to find these objects later in case they get misplaced or lost through the Find My app on the iPhone.

Users can add their AirTag to one Apple ID account, so you cannot access this from the Find My app via other accounts. In case of loss, you must remove the AirTag from your device entirely.
