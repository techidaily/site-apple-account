To add a device to your Apple ID, you have to configure it first and log in with your existing ID from there. This is how it can be added to the Apple ID list of devices.

Apple ID allows you to connect ten devices under the same account. In these ten devices, there cannot be more than five computers associated with the Apple ID.
