Once Apple unlocks the Activation Lock on your Apple iPhone 13 mini, your Apple iPhone 13 mini contents will be permanently erased. Also, note that if you restore your Apple iPhone 13 mini from a local backup, the Activation Lock will re-enable.

To start this request, follow these steps:

- **Step 1:** Head to Apple's Activation Lock support page. (al-support.apple.com)
- **Step 2:** Scroll down the page, select the agreement checkbox, click **Continue**, and it will redirect you to a new page.
