### 1\. Incorrect Attempts

Apple locks your Apple ID mainly when you or someone else has entered the password incorrectly multiple times. This is one of the most common reasons, and mostly, this happens by the original users themselves unintentionally.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### 2\. Preventing Fraudulence

If there are unauthorized purchases or suspicious transactions on your ID, Apple may consider locking it to prevent that activity. It happens to protect the user's financial information and to avoid any fraudulent activity from being done on that Apple ID.

### 3\. Using Third-Party Tools

Sometimes, when using third-party tools based on open-source iCloud sources, the Apple ID could get locked. Developers can integrate iCloud features into their applications to provide users with improved accessibility to their iCloud data.

### 4\. Security Breach Reasons

The ID can also get locked when Apple senses a potential security breach, which could lead to the exposure of your credentials. It may occur when someone tries to hack your ID to get some information, especially when it is being used in multiple areas.

### 5\. Incorrect Security Questions

It may be due to the security questions you or someone else has entered incorrectly too many times. This is another common reason because, most often, the security questions are forgotten by the user. Ultimately, this leads to your Apple ID being locked for security reasons.

## Part 2. Resolving the Apple ID Locked Out For Security Reasons by Resetting The Password

Protecting users’ devices and online accounts is one of the major responsibilities of tech companies like Apple.

Thus, if you create an Apple ID, you can see a two-factor authentication option that adds an extra layer of security.

2FA is activated when the user provides the password to log into the Apple ID or software through a new device, and it acts as a second layer for account security. Apple ID or any software containing sensitive data cannot be accessed without it. This method provides a higher security level than single-factor authentication. To understand more benefits of this security system in detail, check the following points:

1. **Protection From Password Theft:** 2FA acts as an additional security level. It protects your accounts and devices in case your password is leaked.
2. **Migrations of Unauthorized Assets:** Online banking applications use 2FA to protect users from unauthorized bank transfers. If someone accesses their app, this is a beneficial security measure.
3. **Protection on Multiple Services:** Platforms, including social media, banks, and cloud storage, use 2FA. It means that 2FA can be used in various digital aspects.

## Part 2: Can You Remove the Two Factor Authentication iCloud at Anytime

Many people use 2FA globally to protect their personal information and devices from hackers and unauthorized access. However, in some cases, users may want to **remove two-factor authentication iCloud** for multiple reasons. This includes scenarios in which their device is lost or damaged or if they have found a better security option than this one.

Moreover, there is one important key point to note: Apple has removed the feature of deactivating 2FA from the Apple ID. It means you need to think twice before activating this feature on your Apple ID because it cannot be reversed. For the following reasons, Apple has taken this initiative:

1. **Enhanced Security:** By removing the deactivation option for 2FA, Apple is trying to strengthen its account security to ensure that no one can access its user’s data.
2. **Reducing Vulnerabilities:** Allowing users to deactivate 2FA could cause vulnerabilities in the Apple ecosystem that can be a weak point for protecting users’ data. That is why Apple has removed the deactivation option to stop malicious actors from taking advantage of this vulnerability.
3. **Encouraging Security Awareness:** To make Apple users more security conscious, Apple has made it difficult on purpose to remove 2FA. It helps users to be more confident in Apple services and products.
4. **Minimizing Mistakenly Steps:** If users mistakenly remove the 2FA, their accounts and devices are at risk of being accessed without proper authentication. To avoid such an issue, the deactivation option of 2FA is removed.

Besides all these reasons, there is still some good news for those who want to **remove the two-factor authentication iPhone** to use other security options. The good news is that Apple allows users to remove 2FA for a limited time after activation.

As explained in the last part, Apple has made removing the 2FA option from Apple ID challenging for several security reasons. Thus, if you want to remove 2FA from your Apple ID, you have only 14 days after activating this feature. To understand **how to disable iCloud two-factor authentication** within this given time, check the following steps:

- **Step 1.** Once you have activated the 2FA feature, your 14-day grace period will start eventually. To deactivate this, open the enrollment email you received from Apple regarding 2FA on your Apple ID.
- **Step 2.** Scroll to the bottom of this email and select the link or button to return to your account security & settings section. There, follow the on-screen instructions to deactivate the 2FA of your Apple ID.
