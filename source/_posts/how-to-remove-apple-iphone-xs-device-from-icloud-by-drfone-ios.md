- **Step 3: Connect the iOS Device**

Connect the iOS device to the computer using its lightning cable. Then enter the Apple iPhone XS device’s passcode and, when prompted, tap “Trust” to allow the computer to detect the Apple iPhone XS device. The program should detect the Apple iPhone XS device and display information about it. Then click “Unlock Now”.

- **Step 4: Apple ID Removal will Begin**

Dr.Fone will immediately begin removing the Apple ID from the Apple iPhone XS device. You should see a progress bar indicating how long the process will take. Ordinarily, the removal should take just a few seconds. When the process is complete, you will see a notification on the screen letting you know that the Apple ID has been removed.
