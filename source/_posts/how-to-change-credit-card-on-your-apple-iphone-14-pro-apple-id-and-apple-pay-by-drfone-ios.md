## Part 1. Why is Apple Account Locked?

Although annoying, Apple locks your Apple Account for a good reason. There might be various reasons, but the most common one is that your account’s integrity was in danger. Apple locks your account when it sees an “unusual activity” surrounding your account or device. It generally happens when some unauthorized person attempts to access your account.

Your activity can also lock your account. If you fail to log in to your Apple ID several times, Apple might lock it. Moreover, your account can even get locked when you answer the security questions incorrectly more than once. Furthermore, Apple tries to keep your ID dedicated to a few devices.
