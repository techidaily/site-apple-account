## How To Fix Apple ID Verification Code Not Working On Apple iPhone 11 Pro

In smartphones, the Apple ID stands out as a cornerstone of security for iPhone users and the broader iOS ecosystem. Its robust verification features are a key reason why many people choose iPhones. Thus, its heightened security is highly valued. However, even extremely reliable systems can encounter hiccups.

Sometimes, you might need help with the issue of the **Apple ID verification code not working**. This leads to frustration, especially if you need to remember your Apple iPhone 11 Pro ID details. This 2024 guide will delve into practical solutions to fix issues with Apple ID verification codes, helping you [<u>regain access </u> <u>t</u><u>o Apple ID</u>](https://drfone.wondershare.com/icloud/how-recover-forgot-apple-id-password-from-icloud-itunes-and-app-store.html) and peace of mind.

![verification failed prompt apple](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/apple-id-verification-not-working-01.jpg)

## Part 1: When Does the Apple Verification ID Failed Prompt Appear?

Before diving into solutions, it’s essential to understand the various scenarios that can trigger the “**Apple Verification ID Failed**” prompt. Recognizing the cause of the problem is the first step toward the right fix. Let’s explore the common reasons you might encounter this issue:

### Wrong Password Input

One of the most straightforward reasons for a failed verification is entering the wrong password. This could be a simple typing error or misremembering your password. Repeated wrong attempts can also lead to your account being temporarily disabled as a security measure.

### Apple Server Issues

At times, the problem may not be on your end. Apple’s servers can experience downtime or technical glitches like any other online service. During such instances, verification processes might fail, as the server cannot authenticate your credentials.

![apple server status page](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/apple-id-verification-not-working-02.jpg)

### Slow Internet or Intermittent Connection

A stable and reliable internet connection is improtant for the verification process. If your internet is slow or experiencing intermittent connectivity, it can disrupt the communication between your device and Apple’s servers, leading to verification failure.

### Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) Issues

Apple’s two-factor authentication provides an extra layer of security. However, it can also be a source of problems. If there’s a delay in receiving the 2FA code or if [<u>2FA fails to work</u>](https://drfone.wondershare.com/android-issue/authentication-error.html), you won’t be able to complete the verification process. This could be due to network issues or, sometimes, glitches within the 2FA system itself.

### Suspicious Activity

Apple takes your security seriously. If there’s any unusual activity detected on your account, such as login attempts from unfamiliar locations or devices, Apple might lock your account as a precaution. This can trigger the verification failed prompt as the system seeks to protect your account from potential unauthorized access.

By understanding these scenarios, you can diagnose better why you’re facing the issue of **Apple verification ID not working**. In the following sections, we will explore solutions tailored to these specific problems, helping you regain access to your account efficiently.

## Part 2: How To Fix Apple ID Verification Failed

Encountering an “**Apple ID Verification Failed**” error can be frustrating. Here are some practical solutions that correspond to the common reasons for this issue. These steps should help you regain access to your Apple ID.

### Method 1: Connecting to a Stabler Internet Connection

A stable internet connection is crucial. If you’re encountering issues, switch to a more reliable Wi-Fi network. Alternatively, toggling your Wi-Fi or mobile data off and back on can refresh your connection.

### Method 2: Changing Password/2FA Device Using Apple ID Account

If you’re facing troubles due to password errors or 2FA issues, resetting your password or updating 2FA settings may help. Visit **Settings** > **Apple ID account page** > **Sign In & Security** and follow the instructions to **Change Password** or update your **Two-Factor Authentication** settings.

![change password 2-factor authentication](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/apple-id-verification-not-working-03.jpg)

### Method 3: Check iPhone’s Date & Time Settings

Incorrect date and time settings can influence Apple ID verification. Go to **Settings**, select **General**, and tap on **Date & Time**. Ensure **Set Automatically** is enabled, allowing your Apple iPhone 11 Pro to adjust these settings according to your time zone.

![date & time settings ios](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/apple-id-verification-not-working-04.jpg)

### Method 4: Signing Out/In Your Apple ID

Sometimes, simply signing out and back into your Apple ID can resolve verification issues. Navigate to **Settings**, tap your name at the top, scroll down, and select **Sign Out**. After signing out, sign back in and check if the issue persists.

### Method 5: Disabling VPN

If you’re using a VPN, it can sometimes cause issues with Apple ID verification. Try disabling your VPN from the **Settings** or the VPN app you’re using, and then attempt the verification process again.

### Method 6: Updating to the Latest iOS

Running an outdated iOS version can cause compatibility issues. Go to **Settings**, select **General**, and tap on **Software Update**. If an update is available, download and install it to ensure your device is up-to-date.

### Method 7: Checking Apple Server Status and Trying Again Later

Sometimes, the problem is on Apple’s end. Check the Apple System Status page to see if there are any issues with their servers. If there are, it’s best to wait and try the verification process later.

By following these methods, you should be able to resolve the “Apple ID Verification Failed” issue and regain full access to your Apple ID functionalities.
