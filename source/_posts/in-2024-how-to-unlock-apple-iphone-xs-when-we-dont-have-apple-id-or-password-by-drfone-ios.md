Here’s how to use Dr.Fone Screen Unlock to remove the Apple ID from the Apple iPhone XS device;

- **Step 1: Install the Program**

To begin, download the Dr.Fone Toolkit from the program’s main website. Install the toolkit onto your computer. Open it after successful installation and then choose “Screen Unlock” from the main screen.

- **Step 2: Choose to Remove Apple ID**

On the next screen, you should see three options. Choose “Remove Apple ID” since we want to remove the Apple ID from the Apple iPhone XS device.

- **Step 3: Connect the iOS Device**

Connect the iOS device to the computer using its lightning cable. Then enter the Apple iPhone XS device’s passcode and, when prompted, tap “Trust” to allow the computer to detect the Apple iPhone XS device. The program should detect the Apple iPhone XS device and display information about it. Then click “Unlock Now”.

Ordinarily, the removal should take just a few seconds. When the process is complete, you will see a notification on the screen letting you know that the Apple ID has been removed.
