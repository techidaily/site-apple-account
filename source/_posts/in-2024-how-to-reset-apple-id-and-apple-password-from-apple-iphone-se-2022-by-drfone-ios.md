## Part 1: A Preliminary Check

Before doing anything else, it may just happen that you have not forgotten Apple ID password but you are just making a small mistake when signing in to your account. Here is a quick checklist you should review before subjecting yourself to a meaningless hassle:

1. Turn off your Caps Lock as you type in your password unless you have uppercase letters in your password of course.
2. If you have more than one email address, you could sometimes get them mixed up so review the email you are using to sign in. You could also have made a spelling mistake in your email address.
3. Lastly, your sign in attempts may be fruitless because your account has been disabled for security reasons. In this case you should receive a notification asking you to reset your password so go over your emails.

If none of the above solutions work, you can safely conclude that you forgot Apple ID password but not to worry, we've has got you covered. Also, before we proceed with any solutions, it's better to [backup iPhone without passcode](https://drfone.wondershare.com/backup-iphone/backup-locked-iphone-data.html), to invoid any data loss during the process.

## Part 6: Using Apple's Two-step Verification (Forgot Apple Password)

Two-step authentication is an old Apple security feature and it still happens to be up and running. If you had set it up for your account, you can use it if you forgot Apple ID password. Here's how it works:

1. Go to the URL [iforgot.apple.com](http://iforgot.apple.com/).
2. Click the "Enter your Apple ID" option and type in your Apple ID to launch the recovery process.
3. You should be prompted to enter your recovery key. Type it in and click "Continue".

![check forgot apple id](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/elcapitan-apple-id-two-step-recovery-key.jpg)

1. You should then choose a trusted recovery device that is currently available to you and click "Next".
2. Apple should send a verification code to the Apple iPhone SE (2022) device you selected. Enter this code as requested on the website and click "Next".
3. After the verification is complete, you can now set up a new password and hopefully, you'll remember it this time.

**Note:** Be wary of using recovery keys! Though they are a very secure and effective method of password recovery, you could easily get permanently locked out of your Apple account. When using a recovery key, you initially need:

1. An Apple ID password.
2. A trusted device that you can easily access.
3. The actual Recovery Key.

Now if you happen to lose any two of the above at the same time, there is no way of recovering your account and you simply have to create a new one.

The trusted device, however, only works if it has a passcode enabled.

### How to reset Apple password on Your own iPhone

1. Open [iforgot.apple.com](http://iforgot.apple.com/) on any web browser and enter your Apple ID.
2. You can now choose to "Reset from another device," or you can "Use trusted phone number." Choose either option, then click "Continue."

![check forgot apple id](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/appleid-password-recovery-two-factor-screens-01.jpg)
