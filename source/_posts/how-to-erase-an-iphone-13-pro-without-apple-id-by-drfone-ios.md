- Step 2: Start the Unlocking Process and Connect Your iDevice

You will find yourself in a list of options from where you need to continue with the "Unlock Screen Time Passcode" option. Next, connect your iOS device to the computer via a USB cable. Then, wait for Wondershare Dr.Fone to detect your Apple iPhone 13 Pro.

- Step 3: Unlock Your iDevice and Toggle off Find My Feature

After the connection, select the "Unlock Now" button to unlock your screen time passcode, and turn off the "Find My iPhone" feature by following the on-screen instructions. Completion of the screen time passcode unlocking process will start to display after clicking the "OK" button. Finally, after the completion message, hit "Done" to end the entire operation.
