## Part 4: Erase an iPhone Without Apple ID via Activation Lock Support Request

Once Apple unlocks the Activation Lock on your Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max, your Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max contents will be permanently erased. Also, note that if you restore your Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max from a local backup, the Activation Lock will re-enable.

To start this request, follow these steps:

- **Step 1:** Head to Apple's Activation Lock support page. (al-support.apple.com)
- **Step 2:** Scroll down the page, select the agreement checkbox, click **Continue**, and it will redirect you to a new page.
