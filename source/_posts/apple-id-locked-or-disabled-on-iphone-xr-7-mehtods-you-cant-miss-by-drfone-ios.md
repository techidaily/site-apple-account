## Apple ID Locked or Disabled On Apple iPhone XR? 7 Mehtods You Can't-Miss

Apple ID refers to the authentication method available for the Apple iPhone XR device to compromise users' personal information and settings. The Apple iPhone XR Apple ID will allow you to store and control data available on the Apple iPhone XR device; however, you need to re-generate the Apple iPhone XR passcode if you have forgotten the Apple iPhone XR passcode. Suppose, if you have forgotten the passcode and entered the wrong passcode six times, your Apple iPhone XR gets locked or has been disabled. According to your settings, if you have entered the wrong passcode too much time could even make your Apple iPhone XR delete all the data available.

This article will discuss how you can **unlock Apple ID** and remain secure. If you receive a message that you have entered the wrong passcode or forgotten your passcode, you have to follow some steps to regain access to your Apple Id.
