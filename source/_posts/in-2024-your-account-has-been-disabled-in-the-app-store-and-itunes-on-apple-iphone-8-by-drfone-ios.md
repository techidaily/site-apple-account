- Step 1: Choose the Remove Apple ID Tool

Begin the process by installing Wondershare Dr.Fone on your computer and accessing its main interface. After this, tap on the "Toolbox" from the left side toolbar and choose the "Screen Unlock" option. This will take you to a new window where you need to select "iOS" as your device's nature. From the new window, tap on the "Remove Apple ID" to proceed with the Apple ID unlocking process.

- Step 2: Proceed Further by Choosing the Respective Options

Ensure that your iOS device whose lock you are trying to remove is connected to your computer and tap “Unlock Now.” Moving ahead, the platform will ask you whether screen lock and 2FA are enabled. This needs to be enabled for the Apple ID removal process. After this, put your device in Recovery Mode with the help of on-screen instructions.
