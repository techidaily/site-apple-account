<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### 1\. Incorrect Attempts

Apple locks your Apple ID mainly when you or someone else has entered the password incorrectly multiple times. This is one of the most common reasons, and mostly, this happens by the original users themselves unintentionally.

### 2\. Preventing Fraudulence

If there are unauthorized purchases or suspicious transactions on your ID, Apple may consider locking it to prevent that activity. It happens to protect the user's financial information and to avoid any fraudulent activity from being done on that Apple ID.

### 3\. Using Third-Party Tools

Sometimes, when using third-party tools based on open-source iCloud sources, the Apple ID could get locked. Developers can integrate iCloud features into their applications to provide users with improved accessibility to their iCloud data.

### 4\. Security Breach Reasons

The ID can also get locked when Apple senses a potential security breach, which could lead to the exposure of your credentials. It may occur when someone tries to hack your ID to get some information, especially when it is being used in multiple areas.

## Part 1. Why is Apple Account Locked?

Although annoying, Apple locks your Apple Account for a good reason. There might be various reasons, but the most common one is that your account’s integrity was in danger. Apple locks your account when it sees an “unusual activity” surrounding your account or device. It generally happens when some unauthorized person attempts to access your account.

Your activity can also lock your account. If you fail to log in to your Apple ID several times, Apple might lock it. Moreover, your account can even get locked when you answer the security questions incorrectly more than once. Furthermore, Apple tries to keep your ID dedicated to a few devices. Besides, it could shut it down when you aimlessly try to open the account on multiple Apple devices.
