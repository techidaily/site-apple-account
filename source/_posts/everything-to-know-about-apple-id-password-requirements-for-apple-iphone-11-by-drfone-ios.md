## Part 1: A Checklist on What To Do Before Erasing an iPhone

If you're looking at **how to erase an iPhone without an Apple ID** or account password, you've come to the right place. Before you begin, preparing your device and ensuring you have all the necessary information is crucial. Here's a checklist of what to do before erasing your Apple iPhone 11:

Backup Your Apple iPhone 11

You can [<u>back up to iCloud</u>](https://drfone.wondershare.com/iphone-backup-and-restore.html) or use Finder on macOS 10.15 or later. Remember that iCloud backups are stored on Apple's servers and always encrypts backups. On the other hand, computer backups are stored on your computer's hard drive and require a connection to the backup computer. Consider what your needs and preferences are when choosing between these two backup options.

Ready Your Apple ID Password

You may be asked to provide your Apple ID password to disable the Find My iPhone function and remove the Apple iPhone 11 device from your account. Have it handy to avoid any delays. It's necessary for security verification during the erasure process.

Unpair Apple Watch

If you own an Apple Watch, unpair it from your Apple iPhone 11. It ensures a smooth disconnection and prevents complications when erasing the Apple iPhone 11 device.
