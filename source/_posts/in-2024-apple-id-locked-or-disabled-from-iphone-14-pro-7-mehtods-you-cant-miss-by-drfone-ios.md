## Why Is Your Apple ID Locked or Disabled?

![apple id locked](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/03/apple-id-locked.png)

- If you have entered the wrong passcode or security question too many times in a row, Apple ID gets locked. (Avoid entering the incorrect password more than 3 times)
- If you haven't used your Apple ID for an extended period, possibly making your Apple ID disabled or locked. When Apple modifies the requirement for passcode and security questions, you have not updated the information.

If you frequently change your Apple ID or passcode on the Apple iPhone 14 Pro device, Apple possibly considers that your Apple iPhone 14 Pro faces a security threat and might lock your Apple ID.

## Part I. Apple ID Password Requirements: What You Need To Know

Your Apple ID is the gatekeeper to a world of digital wonders, and a sturdy password is your first line of defense. Let's unravel the secrets of crafting unbreakable **Apple ID passwords with requirements examples** that keep your account secure and your mind at ease.

- **Length and Complexity**

When it comes to passwords, size matters! Apple recommends a minimum of eight characters, but why stop there? Aim for a longer passphrase to add an extra layer of security. Mix it up with a blend of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and sprinkle in some special characters for good measure.

- **Avoid Common Pitfalls**

Beware of the password pitfalls! Apple urges users to steer clear of common patterns and dictionary words. Craft a password that is uniquely yours, steering away from easily guessable choices. You create a password that stands tall against potential threats by dodging the usual suspects.
