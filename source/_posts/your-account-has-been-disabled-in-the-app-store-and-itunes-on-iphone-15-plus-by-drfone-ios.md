### Check Your Account for Unusual Activities

Review your recent account activity. Look for unfamiliar devices or locations accessing your Apple ID. If you spot any suspicious actions, change your password and take necessary security measures.

### Stay Informed About Apple's Policies

Familiarize yourself with Apple's terms of service and policies to avoid violating them. It will help prevent account disablement due to policy breaches.

Be cautious of unsolicited emails, messages, or websites that request your Apple ID credentials. Always verify the authenticity of communication from Apple.

### Secure Your Devices

Use a passcode, Touch ID, or Face ID to protect your Apple devices. It adds an extra layer of security to your account.

## Conclusion

By implementing strong security practices, you can prevent future lockouts. You should also monitor your account for unusual activities as an added measure.
