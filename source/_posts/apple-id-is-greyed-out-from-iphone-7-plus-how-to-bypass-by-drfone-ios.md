### 2nd Method

There is another alternative method available to check if the previous owner has considerable trust in you. They would have to share their Apple ID credentials, which then can be easily removed by following the steps while using the same iPhone.

### 3rd Method

- In cases where the previous account is not activated, users can apply this method for iPhone models later than iPhone 6S.
- Connect with the desktop and open iTunes on it. Initiate a force restart by holding down the sleep button and volume down button for 10 seconds.
- Release the Sleep button and keep a hold of the volume down button for another 10 seconds.
- The screen on the Apple iPhone 7 Plus should be black. Following this, a message would appear on the desktop screen showing an iPhone in recovery mode.
- By clicking "Ok," the restoration of the Apple iPhone 7 Plus shall start.
