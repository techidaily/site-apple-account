## Way 5: Reset Apple ID Password Through Requesting Account Recovery

Did all previous methods fail to yield the desired outcome? You can request an account recovery through the official Apple iForgot website. This process facilitates a comprehensive account recovery procedure. It enables users to regain access to their Apple ID account with the help of Apple's support team.

All you need to do is contact Apple support and request resetting your Apple ID password. It usually takes up to 72 hours for this process to complete.
