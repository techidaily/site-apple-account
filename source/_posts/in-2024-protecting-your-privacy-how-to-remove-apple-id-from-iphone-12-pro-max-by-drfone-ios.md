- **On macOS**: Open **SystemPreferences**, select **Apple** **ID,** and click **Sign** **Out**. Sign in again.

### Reset Your Apple ID Password

Security concerns related to compromised credentials can contribute to the connection problem. If in doubt, initiate a password reset for your Apple ID. It not only enhances account security but also addresses authentication errors. Here's how.

### Disable VPN

If you use a Virtual Private Network (VPN), consider temporarily disabling it. VPNs can sometimes interfere with the connection to Apple's servers, causing the error. Disabling the VPN allows you to test whether it's the source of the problem.

### Adjust Date and Time Settings Automatically

Inaccurate date and time settings on your device can lead to authentication failures. Ensure your device's date and time are accurate and set to update automatically. This prevents synchronization issues with the Apple ID server.
