**Step 1:** You need to first visit iforgot.apple.com and then punch in your Apple ID in the text field provided.

**Step 2:** You'll then be required to enter the Recovery Key, key it in and hit “Continue”.

**Step 3:** Now, one of your trusted devices will receive a verification code. Enter it on your screen and hit “Next”.

**Step 4:** Upon successful verification, you will be asked to create a new password. Please make a new password now and then make sure to remember it.

That's it you can now make use of this new password to unlock your Apple ID.
