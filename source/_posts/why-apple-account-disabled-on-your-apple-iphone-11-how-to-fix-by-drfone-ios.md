There are several instances where you encounter such prompt messages where you are restricted in using the App Store and iTunes. These messages can come in the form of "Your account has been disabled in the App Store and iTunes."

No. The error message “Your account has been disabled in the App Store and iTunes” differs from “Apple ID disabled”.
