## Apple ID Locked or Disabled On Apple iPhone XS Max? 7 Mehtods You Can't-Miss

Apple ID refers to the authentication method available for the Apple iPhone XS Max device to compromise users' personal information and settings. The Apple iPhone XS Max Apple ID will allow you to store and control data available on the Apple iPhone XS Max device; however, you need to re-generate the Apple iPhone XS Max passcode if you have forgotten the Apple iPhone XS Max passcode. Suppose, if you have forgotten the passcode and entered the wrong passcode six times, your Apple iPhone XS Max gets locked or has been disabled. According to your settings, if you have entered the wrong passcode too much time could even make your Apple iPhone XS Max delete all the data available.

This article will discuss how you can **unlock Apple ID** and remain secure. If you receive a message that you have entered the wrong passcode or forgotten your passcode, you have to follow some steps to regain access to your Apple Id.

## Why Is Your Apple ID Locked or Disabled?

![apple id locked](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/03/apple-id-locked.png)

Some of the reasons causing your Apple ID locked or disabled are listed below:

- If you have entered the wrong passcode or security question too many times in a row, Apple ID gets locked. (Avoid entering the incorrect password more than 3 times)
- If you haven't used your Apple ID for an extended period, possibly making your Apple ID disabled or locked. When Apple modifies the requirement for passcode and security questions, you have not updated the information.

If you frequently change your Apple ID or passcode on the Apple iPhone XS Max device, Apple possibly considers that your Apple iPhone XS Max faces a security threat and might lock your Apple ID.
