## Apple ID Locked or Disabled On Apple iPhone 11 Pro? 7 Mehtods You Can't-Miss

Apple ID refers to the authentication method available for the Apple iPhone 11 Pro device to compromise users' personal information and settings. The Apple iPhone 11 Pro Apple ID will allow you to store and control data available on the Apple iPhone 11 Pro device; however, you need to re-generate the Apple iPhone 11 Pro passcode if you have forgotten the Apple iPhone 11 Pro passcode. Suppose, if you have forgotten the passcode and entered the wrong passcode six times, your Apple iPhone 11 Pro gets locked or has been disabled. According to your settings, if you have entered the wrong passcode too much time could even make your Apple iPhone 11 Pro delete all the data available.

This article will discuss how you can **unlock Apple ID** and remain secure. If you receive a message that you have entered the wrong passcode or forgotten your passcode, you have to follow some steps to regain access to your Apple Id.

![apple id locked](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/03/apple-id-locked.png)

Some of the reasons causing your Apple ID locked or disabled are listed below:

- If you have entered the wrong passcode or security question too many times in a row, Apple ID gets locked. ( Avoid entering the incorrect password more than 3 times)
- If you haven't used your Apple ID for an extended period, possibly making your Apple ID disabled or locked. When Apple modifies the requirement for passcode and security questions, you have not updated the information.

If you frequently change your Apple ID or passcode on the Apple iPhone 11 Pro device, Apple possibly considers that your Apple iPhone 11 Pro faces a security threat and might lock your Apple ID.

## Why Apple Account Disabled On your Apple iPhone 11 Pro? How to Fix

Apple is one of the leading smartphone developing enterprises that has introduced the world to a contemporary set of features that are not common among other leading smartphone companies. One of the major distinguishing characteristics of Apple has been displayed in its present security protocols. Apple Account is regarded as one of the most significant credentials of the Apple iPhone 11 Pro and iPad that is responsible for connecting and holding the applications and the assorted data. Many users have generally reported unusual situations that got their Apple Account disabled. There are several reasons that can be associated with the Apple account getting disabled. The major repercussion that is associated with it is unnecessary data loss following the suspension of all products that have been bought with the account over time. This article provides you an impressive overview of the major reasons that lead to your Apple Account getting disabled, followed by the associated mechanisms that can be tested to secure the account.

## Part 1. Why is the Apple account disabled?

Apple iPhone, iPad, and other devices operate over a single Operating System, with its own protocols and unique mechanisms that distinguish it from other smartphone models in the market. Apple believes in securing the data and identification of its users with its state-of-the-art security measures. Under such circumstances, it usually gets possible for the user to have his Apple account disabled unnecessarily. Whenever you encounter such a situation, there are several messages that might be displayed on your device to prompt you over the disabling of the account. These messages usually appear in situations where you intend to sign in to some platform with your associated Apple ID. The most common messages that appear on the screen are:

- "This Apple ID has been disabled for security reasons."
- “You can’t sign in because your account was disabled for security reasons.”
- "This Apple ID has been locked for security reasons."

The messages that have been stated above are usually depicting a security anomaly that led to the disabling of the associated Apple ID. However, there can be several reasons that would have led to such circumstances, which are described as follows.

- There might be incorrect forced logging in into your Apple ID for multiple tries.
- Any user would have entered incorrect security questions multiple times.
- The other information associated with the Apple ID would have been entered incorrectly numerous times.

## Part 2. Is “Your account has been disabled in the App Store and iTunes” the same as “This Apple ID has been disabled for security reasons”?

There are several instances where you encounter such prompt messages where you are restricted in using the App Store and iTunes. These messages can come in the form of "Your account has been disabled in the App Store and iTunes." Over observing this prompt message, it has been discovered that the assorted message is not related to the other common message of "This Apple ID has been disabled for security reasons." The dynamics of getting restricted from using the App Store and iTunes are related to remaining balances that have stuck around for a while over your Apple account. Normally, you may have some billing issues that are prevailing over an unpaid iTunes or App Store order. This problem can be countered through simplistic methods under such conditions where you are having access to the account information and can check for the basic billing information or update the payment method following other settings that are associated with paying bills. Over failure in accessing your account, you are required to contact Apple Support and look for the billing and payment statements to clear up all the remaining dues. Apple has considered covering all the security protocols to perfection, where you have any prevailing Apple charges on your connected credit card that would lead to direct disabling of your Apple Account.

Even though Apple accounts can be generally disabled overpayment issues, there are several security reasons that might restrict you in discovering and buying different products across the App Store and iTunes.
