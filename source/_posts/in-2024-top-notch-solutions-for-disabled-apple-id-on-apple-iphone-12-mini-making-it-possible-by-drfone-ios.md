**Step 5**: Successfully, you have unlocked your Apple ID.

## Method 4: Unlock Apple ID Using Two-Factor Authentication

This next method only works if you've already enabled the Two-Factor Authentication before getting locked out of your Apple ID. In case you've already enabled it, follow the below-mentioned steps to unlock your Apple ID.

**Step 1:** Launch the “Settings” App on your Apple iPhone 12 mini and then hit “your name” at the top.

**Step 2:** Now, select the "Password & Security" option, followed by tapping on "Change Password."

**Step 3:** Then you need to follow the instructions displayed over your screen carefully.

If you perform the instructions properly, you will eventually get your Apple ID unlocked.

## Method 5: Remove Locked Apple ID Using Recovery Key

There are high chances that you might have protected your Apple ID with a Two-Factor Authentication. In such a case, you need to use your Recovery Key to unlock your Apple ID. Here's how you can get it done.

**Step 1:** You need to first visit iforgot.apple.com and then punch in your Apple ID in the text field provided.

**Step 2:** You'll then be required to enter the Recovery Key, key it in and hit “Continue”.

![enter recovery key](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/03/recovery-key-reset.png)

**Note:** Recovery Key is a security code provided to you when the Two-Factor Authentication is first enabled.

**Step 3:** Now, one of your trusted devices will receive a verification code. Enter it on your screen and hit “Next”.

**Step 4:** Upon successful verification, you will be asked to create a new password. Please make a new password now and then make sure to remember it.

That's it you can now make use of this new password to unlock your Apple ID.

## Method 6: A Loophole: DNS Bypass

If you want to unlock **iPhone 13 Apple ID** and don't remember the password**,** you can use this DNS bypass method. But to make use of this method, you need to first factory reset your device and gain access to the “Hello” screen. Here's how you can make use of this method.

**Step 1:** Firstly, you need to reboot your device into Recovery Mode. Then, launch iTunes and plug it in the computer. Now, iTunes will detect your device in recovery mode. Hit on Restore iPhone and wait for the process to complete.

**Step 2:** Your device will restart to the “Hello” screen upon completion. From the menu, choose language and country.

**Step 3:** Tap on “Proceed” to get into the Wi-Fi settings page.

**Step 4:** Now click on the “i” icon bonded by a circle next to Wi-Fi.

![click i icon](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/03/dns-bypass-1.png)

**Note:** In case, you are already connected to a Wi-Fi network, ensure to click on it first and then tap on “Forget This Network” to have the “i” icon visible.

**Step 5:** Now, when you tap on the “i” icon next to any Wi-Fi network (not connected), you need to look for the “Configure DNS” server option. Click on it and then select “Manual”, then click “Add Server.”

![configure dns server](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/03/dns-bypass-2.png)

You have to select the DNS from the option available according to your region.

- USA/North America: 104.154.51.7
- Europe: 104.155.28.90
- Asia: 104.155.220.58
- Other areas: 78.109.17.60

**Step 6:** Now, save the settings, return to the connection page and connect to your Wi-Fi.

**Step 7:** You need to wait for your device to get connected with the iCloud DNS bypass server automatically.

![iclouddnsbypass home](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/03/dns-bypass-3.png)

**Step 8:** Once you are connected to the DNS server successfully, you can then use apps and features available on your Apple iPhone 12 mini in an alternative way.

**Note:** This method is just a hack to use your device without the need for Apple ID. This method doesn't unlock your Apple ID.
