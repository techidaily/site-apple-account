## Part 5. FAQs about Apple ID Phone Number

1. **How to Add a Trusted Phone Number to Your Apple ID?**

The steps for adding the trusted phone number to Apple ID are accessible through Settings > Apple ID icon/name > Password & Security > Edit icon beside the phone number already in use. Click on the "Add a trusted phone number" option and insert the new one. Confirm with your device passcode at the end.
