### Use Strong Security Practices

Enable two-factor authentication for an extra layer of security. Use a complex and unique password. Use a mix of upper and lower-case letters, numbers, and symbols. Avoid using guessable information, like birthdays or common words.

### Update Your Apple ID Information

Keep your contact information, recovery email, and security questions up to date. This ensures you can regain access if you forget your password or face account-related issues.

### Check Your Account for Unusual Activities

Review your recent account activity. Look for unfamiliar devices or locations accessing your Apple ID. If you spot any suspicious actions, change your password and take necessary security measures.

### Stay Informed About Apple's Policies

Familiarize yourself with Apple's terms of service and policies to avoid violating them. It will help prevent account disablement due to policy breaches.

### Beware of Phishing Attempts

Be cautious of unsolicited emails, messages, or websites that request your Apple ID credentials. Always verify the authenticity of communication from Apple.

### Secure Your Devices

Use a passcode, Touch ID, or Face ID to protect your Apple devices. It adds an extra layer of security to your account.

By implementing strong security practices, you can prevent future lockouts. You should also monitor your account for unusual activities as an added measure.
