- **Step 1:** Launch the “Find My” app on the other trusted iPad or iPhone and tap the "Devices" option. From all the Apple iPhone 14 Plus devices connected to the Apple ID, find and select the targeted iPad.
- **Step 2:** After finding the iPad, tap "Erase This Device" and follow it by pressing "Continue." Finally, confirm your action by tapping "Erase" and providing the Apple ID password.
