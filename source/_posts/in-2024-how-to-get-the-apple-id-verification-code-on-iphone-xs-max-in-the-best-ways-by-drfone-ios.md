1. **How to Set Up and Add an AirTag on Your Apple iPhone XS Max?**

Firstly, get your device ready to get set up. Remove the wrap around the AirTag and pull the tab out to start the battery. After it plays a tiny sound, hold the Apple iPhone XS Max device near the iPhone/iPad and press Connect. Next, change the name of the AirTag on your list, give an emoji to it, and press Continue. Register it with the Apple ID in the next prompt and then choose Done.

2. **How to Rename AirTag and Change Its Emoji?**

You can access the Items tab on the Find My application and choose the AirTagged item. Then, scroll downward and choose Rename item to change the name. Finally, create a customized name and add an emoji as well.

3. **How Far Can You Track an Apple AirTag?**

With the Bluetooth connection switched on, one can track Apple AirTag for approximately 100 feet.

### Conclusion

The added AirTag stays connected with one Apple ID account until you reset it. So, use the process mentioned to remove the AirTag via iPhone or iPad. If the iPad or iPhone you are using has locked the Apple ID, you can use another software [Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/iphone-unlock/), to access it without data loss securely. Then, follow the steps mentioned to reset the AirTag here.
