### 1.2 Delete iCloud account via iTunes

Another convenient way to delete the iCloud account is to use iTunes on your Apple iPhone 6s. Let’s walk you through the process of deleting an iCloud account using iTunes.

**Step 1:** First of all, make sure to disable the “Find My iPhone” feature. Navigate to “Settings” > “iCloud” > “Find My iPhone” and toggle the switch off to turn off the feature.

![disable find my iphone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2020/05/disable-find-my-iphone.jpg)

### 1.3 Create a new password

If you have enabled two-way verification on your Apple iPhone 6s, you can also delete the iCloud account by resetting the password. In this case, however, you’ll have to visit the [Apple ID Account Page](https://appleid.apple.com/) and use it to reset the password.

Here’s how to delete iCloud account without password by creating a new password.

**Step 1:** Visit the Apple ID Account page and select “Forgot Apple ID or Password”.

![forgot apple id or password](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2020/05/forgot-apple-id-or-password.jpg)

**Step 2:** Now, enter your Apple ID and tap “Continue”. Select “I Need to Reset My Password” to initiate the password resetting process.

**Step 3:** You’ll be prompted to a new window where you’ll have to enter the “Recover Key”. This key is an exclusive that’s generated when a user enables two-way verification for their iCloud account.

**Step 4:** Enter the recovery key and tap “Continue”. Now, select a trusted device where you want to receive the verification code. Enter this verification code to continue with the process.

![enter recovery key](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2020/05/enter-recovery-key.jpg)

**Step 5:** In the next window, you can reset the password. Simply, add the new password and click the “Reset Password” button.

Once the password is changed, you can easily delete your iCloud account by going to “Settings” > “iCloud” > “Delete Account”. Enter the new password and your iCloud account will be deleted permanently.

In case you haven’t enabled two-way verification for your iCloud account, there’s still a way to reset the password. However, you must remember the security questions that you answered or the recovery e-mail you had added while setting up your iCloud account.

**Step 1:** Open the Apple ID Account page and tap “Forgot Apple ID or Password”. Enter your Apple ID and select “I need to reset my password”.

**Step 2:** You’ll be redirected to a new window displaying two different methods, i.e., “Answer Security Questions” an “Get an Email.” Choose a suitable method and follow the further steps to reset your password.
