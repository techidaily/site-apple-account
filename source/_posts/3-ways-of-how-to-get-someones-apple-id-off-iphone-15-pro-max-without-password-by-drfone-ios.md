## Part 1: A Checklist on What To Do Before Erasing an iPhone

If you're looking at **how to erase an iPhone without an Apple ID** or account password, you've come to the right place. Before you begin, preparing your device and ensuring you have all the necessary information is crucial. Here's a checklist of what to do before erasing your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max:

Backup Your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max

You can [<u>back up to iCloud</u>](https://drfone.wondershare.com/iphone-backup-and-restore.html) or use Finder on macOS 10.15 or later. Remember that iCloud backups are stored on Apple's servers and always encrypts backups. On the other hand, computer backups are stored on your computer's hard drive and require a connection to the backup computer. Consider what your needs and preferences are when choosing between these two backup options.
