**If your Apple ID is signed in on your Macintosh:**

- Go to the Apple Menu, the Apple symbol on the upper left corner of your Mac, and tap "System Preferences."
- Go to "Apple ID" and click the "Password and Security" option. From there, click the "Change Password" option.
- When asked, enter your Mac screen password and click "Allow" afterward.
