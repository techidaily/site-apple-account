### 1.3 Create a new password

If you have enabled two-way verification on your Apple iPhone 14 Pro, you can also delete the iCloud account by resetting the password. In this case, however, you’ll have to visit the [Apple ID Account Page](https://appleid.apple.com/) and use it to reset the password.
