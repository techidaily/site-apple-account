## Part 5: Forgot Apple ID? How to Reset Apple ID

Like your password, Apple can help you recover your Apple ID or username as well. Just follow this concise guide:

1. Open any web browser and go to the following URL: [iforgot.apple.com](http://iforgot.apple.com/).
2. Click the "Forgot Apple ID" option.
3. You will be prompted to enter your First Name, Last Name and your Email Address.
4. You also have the option of entering up to 3 email addresses that you have used in the past.
5. Click the "Next" button after which you will be presented with two other options. Click "Reset By Email" to receive the account reset instructions on your recovery email. Alternatively, click on "Answer Security Questions" to recover your Apple account right there on the website.

## Part 6: Using Apple's Two-step Verification (Forgot Apple Password)

Two-step authentication is an old Apple security feature and it still happens to be up and running. If you had set it up for your account, you can use it if you forgot Apple ID password. Here's how it works:

1. Go to the URL [iforgot.apple.com](http://iforgot.apple.com/).
2. Click the "Enter your Apple ID" option and type in your Apple ID to launch the recovery process.
3. You should be prompted to enter your recovery key. Type it in and click "Continue".

![check forgot apple id](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/elcapitan-apple-id-two-step-recovery-key.jpg)

1. You should then choose a trusted recovery device that is currently available to you and click "Next".
2. Apple should send a verification code to the Apple iPhone XR device you selected. Enter this code as requested on the website and click "Next".
3. After the verification is complete, you can now set up a new password and hopefully, you'll remember it this time.

**Note:** Be wary of using recovery keys! Though they are a very secure and effective method of password recovery, you could easily get permanently locked out of your Apple account. When using a recovery key, you initially need:

1. An Apple ID password.
2. A trusted device that you can easily access.
3. The actual Recovery Key.

Now if you happen to lose any two of the above at the same time, there is no way of recovering your account and you simply have to create a new one.

## Part 7: Using Apple's Two-Factor Authentication (Forgot Apple ID Password)

This is a new account recovery option that is built into iOS 9 and OS X El Capitan. If you have enabled it for your account, you can change or reset Apple password from [iforgot.apple.com](http://iforgot.apple.com/) or from any trusted iPad, iPhone, or iPod touch if you forgot your Apple ID password. The trusted device, however, only works if it has a passcode enabled.

### How to reset Apple password on Your own iPhone

1. Open [iforgot.apple.com](http://iforgot.apple.com/) on any web browser and enter your Apple ID.
2. You can now choose to "Reset from another device," or you can "Use trusted phone number." Choose either option, then click "Continue."

![check forgot apple id](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/appleid-password-recovery-two-factor-screens-01.jpg)

1. It would help if you now waited for prompt requesting access to the trusted device or phone number. Click "Allow." You can now reset your password.

### Recover/reset Apple password on a trusted Apple iOS device

1. On the Apple iPhone XR device, open Settings > iCloud.
2. Select your name, then select "Password & Security."
3. Select "Change Password" and enter your new password. Voila! You're now reunited with your account.

If you can't access the trusted device, you can recover your password on any other iOS device:

### Recover/reset Apple password on any other iOS device

1. Open Settings > iCloud.
2. Select Forgot Apple ID and Password.
3. Follow the given steps to recover your account.

Now, if none of these methods work and you're completely locked out and completely frustrated, then you should [contact Apple](http://support.apple.com/en-us/HT5699) and seek their help to regain access to your account.

## Part 8: Recover lost data (Forgot Apple ID or Apple Password)

If you can't log into your Apple account even after all this hassle, and if you're permanently locked out of your iCloud and Apple accounts, then you can try to [recover iCloud password](https://drfone.wondershare.com/icloud/how-to-recover-icloud-password.html), but your biggest concern should be to save and recover as much data as possible.
