Connect the iOS device to the computer using its lightning cable. Then enter the Apple iPhone 6s Plus device’s passcode and, when prompted, tap “Trust” to allow the computer to detect the Apple iPhone 6s Plus device. The program should detect the Apple iPhone 6s Plus device and display information about it. Then click “Unlock Now”.
