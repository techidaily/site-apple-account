## How to Fix Locked Apple ID on Apple iPhone 13

Part of why you own and use Apple devices is the reliability of the Apple iPhone 13 devices and the ease of using them. This starts with the quality of hardware and the synergy with the software that runs the hardware, and the user experience you get. Apple puts great emphasis on this, and rightly so, for this is one of the keys defining and differentiating factors for people to choose Apple's iOS over Google's Android. Like with all good things in life, sometimes, a spanner is put in the works that bring your smooth-sailing life to an abrupt halt. With smartphones playing pivotal roles in our lives today, from payments to internet experiences to getting work done to stay in touch with people, anything that stops us from using our smartphone or endangers that experience is a cause for worry. A locked Apple ID is one such thing. It does not happen frequently, in fact, most users will never experience a locked Apple ID, but for the ones who are fortunate enough to have such a rare experience in life, help is at hand. All you need to do is relax and read on. By the end of it, you will have an unlocked Apple ID and you can go back to cruising.

## Part I: Difference Between Activation Lock and Locked Apple ID

Apple being Apple, does a lot to make sure that users get the smoothest experience possible when interacting with their Apple products, both hardware, and software. Yet, sometimes, the messaging gets confusing, and people are not sure what is what. One such thing is the difference between iCloud Activation Lock and Apple ID Lock. While people are more likely to encounter Activation Lock and less likely to encounter Apple ID Lock, they are often confused when they encounter Apple ID Lock and struggle to figure out what that means and how to resolve the issue.

Activation Lock is when your supported Apple device is locked for a number of reasons. The most common reason is a stolen device that was locked by its owner, however, there are other perfectly valid reasons such as an outgoing employee forgetting to sign out and erase their Apple device before submitting it back. The IT department would not be able to reset that device without turning off Find My Apple iPhone 13 and Activation Lock on the Apple iPhone 13 device.

A locked Apple ID usually happens when the user has forgotten their password to their Apple ID account and attempts to figure out the password have been unsuccessful. Sometimes, Apple ID gets locked automatically under some conditions, and that requires users to reset their password to gain access. A locked Apple ID does not mean that your device is locked for your use. You can keep using it so long as you do not try to use another Apple ID with it since to do that you would have to sign out of your current Apple ID (which is locked) and you won't be able to do that. On the other hand, Activation Lock renders the entire device unusable till the lock is cleared.

![apple id locked message](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/10/unlock-apple-id-on-iphone-13-3.jpg)

In short, Apple ID Lock is about a user's account with Apple, akin to how Google Account works on Android devices. Apple ID Lock locks a user's account with Apple while retaining complete usage of the Apple iPhone 13 device whereas Activation Lock locks the Apple iPhone 13 device and prevents anyone from using it until the correct credentials are entered. This is about verifying the ownership of the Apple iPhone 13 device and works to deter theft of Apple devices.

## Part II: Checking If Your Apple ID Is Locked

![the message of apple id locked](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/10/unlock-apple-id-on-iphone-13-4.jpg)

A locked Apple ID is rather unmistakable. Your device would keep telling you that your Apple ID is locked for your security. Your Apple ID could be locked or disabled altogether if someone has tried to gain access to your account (and, obviously, failed). Apple would disable access to the Apple ID unless you are able to prove rightful ownership and reset the password successfully.

## Part III: Reasons for Locked Apple ID

There can be a few reasons why your Apple ID is locked. You forgot the password and now it is locked since you entered the wrong password too many times. A scarier prospect, albeit a real one, is that some malicious actor attempted to login into your Apple ID account but failed. Had they succeeded, you would have gotten a message that 'your Apple ID is being used on another device' now.

Apple does a lot to ensure that your Apple ID remains safe. You trust Apple with a lot of your data, including financial data by way of your credit cards associated with Apple ID to make purchases on the App Store and iTunes Store. Therefore, some of the time, Apple preempts issues by proactively locking up your Apple ID or even disabling it. It goes without saying that sometimes it is something so simple as a software error that is believed to have locked up Apple IDs for many users around the world a while ago. It is also entirely possible that it was some malicious actor probing the servers for accounts.

All of these will result in a locked Apple ID that users will have to reset their password to in order to gain access back.

## Part IV: How to Unlock Apple ID on Apple iPhone 13

![apple id webpage](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/10/unlock-apple-id-on-iphone-13-1.jpg)

It is unfortunate you are facing a locked Apple ID. Apple tries its best to make users aware of safety protocols they need to follow to minimize and mitigate such unfortunate occurrences, such as using two-factor authentication, trusted devices, trusted phone numbers, passwords, passcodes, etc. that serve as deterrents to prevent unauthorized access to devices and accounts. Yet, when the unfortunate happens, what to do?

### IV.I: Unlock Apple ID Via Two-Factor Authentication

Apple implemented two-factor authentication a long time ago to prevent unauthorized access to Apple ID accounts. If you have it enabled, you would be able to use two-factor authentication to unlock your Apple ID again.

Step 1: Go to **<https://iforgot.apple.com>**.

![apple id iforgot support page](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/10/unlock-apple-id-on-iphone-13-5.jpg)

Step 2: Key in your Apple ID and proceed.

Step 3: Confirm your mobile number associated with the Apple ID.

![apple id iforgot support ](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/10/unlock-apple-id-on-iphone-13-6.jpg)

If you have another device associated with the Apple ID and it is a trusted device, you can now receive instructions to proceed with a two-factor code on that device.

![using iforgot support page to unlock](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/10/unlock-apple-id-on-iphone-13-7.jpg)

Step 4: Use that code to unlock your Apple ID using two-factor authentication.

## Part V: Conclusion

Considering how much the Apple ID is pivotal to our Apple experience, it can be incredibly unnerving to realize that it is locked or disabled, due to any reason. We use our Apple ID for iCloud services on Apple devices, to make purchases on iTunes Store and App Store and payments using Apple Pay. Apple knows this and has checked in place to make sure that only you are in possession of your Apple ID account at all times. It can cause a little hassle at times, since if someone makes multiple failed attempts to gain access to your account, Apple will lock your Apple ID until you can unlock it with proper verifications and reset your password.

## Part 1: What Is Two-Factor Authentication and How Helpful It Is

Protecting users’ devices and online accounts is one of the major responsibilities of tech companies like Apple. Due to this, they have added multiple security features, including two-factor authentication. Thus, if you create an Apple ID, you can see a two-factor authentication option that adds an extra layer of security.

![what is two factor authentication](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/10/remove-two-factor-authentication-1.jpg)

2FA is activated when the user provides the password to log into the Apple ID or software through a new device, and it acts as a second layer for account security. Apple ID or any software containing sensitive data cannot be accessed without it. This method provides a higher security level than single-factor authentication. To understand more benefits of this security system in detail, check the following points:

1. **Protection From Password Theft:** 2FA acts as an additional security level. It protects your accounts and devices in case your password is leaked.
2. **Migrations of Unauthorized Assets:** Online banking applications use 2FA to protect users from unauthorized bank transfers. If someone accesses their app, this is a beneficial security measure.
3. **Protection on Multiple Services:** Platforms, including social media, banks, and cloud storage, use 2FA. It means that 2FA can be used in various digital aspects.

## Part 2: Can You Remove the Two Factor Authentication iCloud at Anytime

Many people use 2FA globally to protect their personal information and devices from hackers and unauthorized access. However, in some cases, users may want to **remove two-factor authentication iCloud** for multiple reasons. This includes scenarios in which their device is lost or damaged or if they have found a better security option than this one.

Moreover, there is one important key point to note: Apple has removed the feature of deactivating 2FA from the Apple ID. It means you need to think twice before activating this feature on your Apple ID because it cannot be reversed. For the following reasons, Apple has taken this initiative:

1. **Enhanced Security:** By removing the deactivation option for 2FA, Apple is trying to strengthen its account security to ensure that no one can access its user’s data.
2. **Reducing Vulnerabilities:** Allowing users to deactivate 2FA could cause vulnerabilities in the Apple ecosystem that can be a weak point for protecting users’ data. That is why Apple has removed the deactivation option to stop malicious actors from taking advantage of this vulnerability.
3. **Encouraging Security Awareness:** To make Apple users more security conscious, Apple has made it difficult on purpose to remove 2FA. It helps users to be more confident in Apple services and products.
4. **Minimizing Mistakenly Steps:** If users mistakenly remove the 2FA, their accounts and devices are at risk of being accessed without proper authentication. To avoid such an issue, the deactivation option of 2FA is removed.

Besides all these reasons, there is still some good news for those who want to **remove the two-factor authentication iPhone** to use other security options. The good news is that Apple allows users to remove 2FA for a limited time after activation.

## Part 3: How To Remove the Two-Factor Authentication Within 14 Days

As explained in the last part, Apple has made removing the 2FA option from Apple ID challenging for several security reasons. Thus, if you want to remove 2FA from your Apple ID, you have only 14 days after activating this feature. To understand **how to disable iCloud two-factor authentication** within this given time, check the following steps:

- **Step 1.** Once you have activated the 2FA feature, your 14-day grace period will start eventually. To deactivate this, open the enrollment email you received from Apple regarding 2FA on your Apple ID.
- **Step 2.** Scroll to the bottom of this email and select the link or button to return to your account security & settings section. There, follow the on-screen instructions to deactivate the 2FA of your Apple ID.
