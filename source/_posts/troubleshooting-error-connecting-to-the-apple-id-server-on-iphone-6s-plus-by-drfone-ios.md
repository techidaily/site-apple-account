## Part 5. FAQs about Apple ID Phone Number

1. **How to Add a Trusted Phone Number to Your Apple ID?**

The steps for adding the trusted phone number to Apple ID are accessible through Settings > Apple ID icon/name > Password & Security > Edit icon beside the phone number already in use. Click on the "Add a trusted phone number" option and insert the new one. Confirm with your device passcode at the end.

2. **Why Isn't My Apple ID Accepting My Apple iPhone 6s Plus Number?**

Apple ID accepts phone numbers for linking for two-factor authentication. The local number in the region is needed for pairing the number and Apple ID.

3. **Does Changing Apple ID affect Phone Number?**

No, the Apple ID and phone number are not connected as features or codes. So, adjusting the Apple ID will not affect your device's phone number.
