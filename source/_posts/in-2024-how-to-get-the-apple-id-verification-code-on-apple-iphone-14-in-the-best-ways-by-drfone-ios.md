- Step 1: Choose the Remove Apple ID Tool

Begin the process by installing Wondershare Dr.Fone on your computer and accessing its main interface. After this, tap on the "Toolbox" from the left side toolbar and choose the "Screen Unlock" option. This will take you to a new window where you need to select "iOS" as your device's nature. From the new window, tap on the "Remove Apple ID" to proceed with the Apple ID unlocking process.

- Step 2: Proceed Further by Choosing the Respective Options

Ensure that your iOS device whose lock you are trying to remove is connected to your computer and tap “Unlock Now.” Moving ahead, the platform will ask you whether screen lock and 2FA are enabled. This needs to be enabled for the Apple ID removal process. After this, put your device in Recovery Mode with the help of on-screen instructions.

- Step 3: Select the iOS Firmware Version

Once the platform detects your device model, choose your system version and then click the "Start" button. The respective iOS firmware will start downloading, and Wondershare Dr.Fone will verify it once it is downloaded. Following this, click "Unlock Now," which will lead to a warning popup.

- Step 4: Conclude the Process To Unlock Your Apple ID

The warning informs you about the imminent data loss that will result during Apple ID unlocking. To confirm that you agree with the procedure, you are required to type in "000000" as the PIN code. Finally, click "Unlock" to start the Apple ID unlocking procedure. On its completion, hit the "Done" button to conclude the process.
