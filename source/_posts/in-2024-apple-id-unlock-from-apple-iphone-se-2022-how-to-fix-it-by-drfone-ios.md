We've given clear, easy-to-follow instructions to facilitate the setup of your Apple Developer account. If your objective is to join the Apple Developer Program, we strongly advise adhering to the enrollment prerequisites outlined earlier in this article.

Additionally, for those who may encounter issues with their Apple ID due to forgotten passwords, we've introduced the Wondershare Dr.Fone tool. This efficient solution provides a seamless method for regaining access to your Apple ID without compromising your data. We highly recommend it for its user-friendliness and compatibility with all iOS devices.
