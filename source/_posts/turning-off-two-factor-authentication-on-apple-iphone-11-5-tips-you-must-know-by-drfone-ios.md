## Turning Off Two Factor Authentication On Apple iPhone 11? 5 Tips You Must Know

Apple has produced one of the most consumed, acknowledged, and preferred smartphones that allowed them to rule the industry for a considerably long period of time. Their style and presentation were not the only reason that made people look forward to buying an iPhone. Apple created its own operating system and presented their own versions of security and protection. One of the most recognized and impeccable features offered by Apple in its innovative structure was the security and safety through Apple ID and Apple Account. Every important feature that operated throughout the Apple iPhone 11 or iPad was focused over a single entity, the Apple ID. However, apart from the Apple ID, there were several other layers of authentications and verifications that were added throughout the protocol structure. A couple of them are renowned as Two Factor Verification and Two Factor Authentication. This article produces a very generous set of advice that should be looked over while handing these layers of protection. To get a better understanding of the procedures involved, you need to look over the guide to gain better knowledge on how to turn off Two Factor Authentication on your Apple.

![two factor authentication apple](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2020/11/two-factor-authentication-apple.jpg)

## Part 1. Is two-step verification the same as two-factor authentication?

There might be a few differences involved in these two security models; however, it should be kept in mind that they focus their purpose on securing the Apple ID of the user. Two Factor Verification is a security protocol that protects access to the various activities performed through the Apple ID. It attenuates an extra verification step across the Apple iPhone 11 device in addition to the password for the Apple ID. The device receives a verification code from an authentication factor that allows the authorities to confirm the credibility of the user.

The Two Factor Authentication is considered as an upgrade to the Two Factor Verification, which was released two years after the Two Factor Verification, in 2015. This authentication method exempted the offline recovery keys and application-specific passcodes. They added a six-digit authentication code onto the original password and produced an offline, time-dependent code that is to be generated through the Settings of the trusted device of the user. This feature was appended into the iOS 9 and OS X El Capitan with a region-specific target.

## Part 2. How to turn off two-step verification?

As you are aware of the Two-Step Verification process, it is quite easy and typical in configuring. However, when it comes to turning the settings off, it is also a simple and straightforward procedure that can be easily covered by following the steps provided below.

**Step 1:** You are required to open the Apple ID Account web page on your browser and sign in with your Apple ID credentials.

**Step 2:** As you log into the website, access the "Security" section, and tap "Edit" from the options provided on the list.

**Step 3:** Tap on the “Two-Step Verification” option and turn it off. Confirm to conclude the process. You may be required to select the new security questions and verify the data of birth in the process. As you would be done with it, an email would be received across your connected address for confirmation.

## Part 3. How to turn off two-factor authentication? (lower than iOS 10.3)

Two Factor Authentication cannot be turned off in a few cases and accounts for iOS versions greater than 10.3. However, if you have activated Two Factor Authentication across the iOS versions lower than 10.3, you can deactivate the feature through a series of simple steps. The exemption of this security feature across your device leaves it protected only through a password and a few security questions. For turning off the Two Factor Authentication from your Apple device, you need to follow the steps provided as follows:

**Step 1:** Open your browser and access your Apple ID Account website. Provide the details of your Apple ID and log in.

**Step 2:** Tap on “Edit” in the “Security” section and turn off the “Two Factor Authentication” option.

**Step 3:** This would lead you to set new security questions for the Apple ID account, followed by a verification of your date of birth. The successful execution of the process would lead to turning it off.

## Part 4. Why can't you turn off two-factor authentication if you already use it? (iOS 10.3 and later)

For users who have an Apple device with an iOS 10.3 or later version, they cannot turn the Two Factor Authentication off after it is accessed. The latest iOS and macOS included extra layers of security in their features, which led towards a better security foundation and protection of information. Users who have updated their account information can unenroll in two weeks after updating. For this, you are required to simply access the confirmation email that you have received and tap on the link to approach the previous security settings. Thus, it makes it far more than impossible for users to turn their Two Factor Authentication off if they consider it unnecessary for their device. This feature is something that would always remain intact with their device as an extra layer of security. Its absence does leave a chance of illegal access to the Apple iPhone 11 device and an increased risk of a security breach. Since it is directly built across the Apple iPhone 11 device and its settings, this makes it a very hard-to-approach characteristic.

## Part 5. How to turn off two-factor authentication by removing Apple ID

Users who are very reluctant to remove the two-factor authentication off their device can consider removing the Apple ID itself for fulfilling the purpose. However, when it comes to executing such tasks, the need for a third-party platform gets evident. Third-party platforms provided dedicated services in providing users with a unique platform of operation with an environment that suits their purpose perfectly. Many platforms provide such impressive services, yet the selection gets quite difficult for a series of reasons. The following pointers explain the reasons to the users over why they should focus on selecting a platform such as [Dr. Fone – Screen Unlock (iOS)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/iphone-unlock/) for this purpose.

- You need to have no excessive knowledge of handling the platform.
- You can cover all the dynamics of unlocking the Apple iPhone 11 device without the use of iTunes.
- The platform provides you with the ability to unlock the passcode of your Apple device with ease.
- It offers you to protect your device from the disabled state.

Dr. Fone – Screen Unlock (iOS) makes it easy for the users to control and remove their Apple ID and disable the two-factor authentication across their device.

**Step 3: Trust the Computer**

Open the Apple iPhone 11 device and tap on “Trust” over the prompt that appears on the screen. Following this, you need to navigate to the Settings of your device to initiate a reboot.

![trust computer](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/drfone/trust-computer.jpg)

**Step 4: Execution of Process**

Once you are done with initiating a reboot, the platform automatically detects the update in the process and initiates removing the Apple ID from the Apple iPhone 11 device. Once the platform is done with the process, it provides a prompt message in the next window displaying the execution of the removal of Apple ID from your device. This also removes the Two Factor Authentication off your device.

## Conclusion

The article has presented a very detailed comparison of the Two Factor Verification and Two Factor Authentication and provided an elaborated discussion over how to turn these security features off their devices. The article also discussed a third-party platform that would guide in removing such security features of the Apple iPhone 11 devices over the requirement of the user. You need to go through this article to get a better knowledge of the execution of the mechanism.



## How to Fix Locked Apple ID on Apple iPhone 11

Part of why you own and use Apple devices is the reliability of the Apple iPhone 11 devices and the ease of using them. This starts with the quality of hardware and the synergy with the software that runs the hardware, and the user experience you get. Apple puts great emphasis on this, and rightly so, for this is one of the keys defining and differentiating factors for people to choose Apple's iOS over Google's Android. Like with all good things in life, sometimes, a spanner is put in the works that bring your smooth-sailing life to an abrupt halt. With smartphones playing pivotal roles in our lives today, from payments to internet experiences to getting work done to stay in touch with people, anything that stops us from using our smartphone or endangers that experience is a cause for worry. A locked Apple ID is one such thing. It does not happen frequently, in fact, most users will never experience a locked Apple ID, but for the ones who are fortunate enough to have such a rare experience in life, help is at hand. All you need to do is relax and read on. By the end of it, you will have an unlocked Apple ID and you can go back to cruising.

## Part I: Difference Between Activation Lock and Locked Apple ID

Apple being Apple, does a lot to make sure that users get the smoothest experience possible when interacting with their Apple products, both hardware, and software. Yet, sometimes, the messaging gets confusing, and people are not sure what is what. One such thing is the difference between iCloud Activation Lock and Apple ID Lock. While people are more likely to encounter Activation Lock and less likely to encounter Apple ID Lock, they are often confused when they encounter Apple ID Lock and struggle to figure out what that means and how to resolve the issue.

Activation Lock is when your supported Apple device is locked for a number of reasons. The most common reason is a stolen device that was locked by its owner, however, there are other perfectly valid reasons such as an outgoing employee forgetting to sign out and erase their Apple device before submitting it back. The IT department would not be able to reset that device without turning off Find My Apple iPhone 11 and Activation Lock on the Apple iPhone 11 device.

A locked Apple ID usually happens when the user has forgotten their password to their Apple ID account and attempts to figure out the password have been unsuccessful. Sometimes, Apple ID gets locked automatically under some conditions, and that requires users to reset their password to gain access. A locked Apple ID does not mean that your device is locked for your use. You can keep using it so long as you do not try to use another Apple ID with it since to do that you would have to sign out of your current Apple ID (which is locked) and you won't be able to do that. On the other hand, Activation Lock renders the entire device unusable till the lock is cleared.

![apple id locked message](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/10/unlock-apple-id-on-iphone-13-3.jpg)

In short, Apple ID Lock is about a user's account with Apple, akin to how Google Account works on Android devices. Apple ID Lock locks a user's account with Apple while retaining complete usage of the Apple iPhone 11 device whereas Activation Lock locks the Apple iPhone 11 device and prevents anyone from using it until the correct credentials are entered. This is about verifying the ownership of the Apple iPhone 11 device and works to deter theft of Apple devices.

## Part II: Checking If Your Apple ID Is Locked

![the message of apple id locked](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/10/unlock-apple-id-on-iphone-13-4.jpg)

A locked Apple ID is rather unmistakable. Your device would keep telling you that your Apple ID is locked for your security. Your Apple ID could be locked or disabled altogether if someone has tried to gain access to your account (and, obviously, failed). Apple would disable access to the Apple ID unless you are able to prove rightful ownership and reset the password successfully.

## Part III: Reasons for Locked Apple ID

There can be a few reasons why your Apple ID is locked. You forgot the password and now it is locked since you entered the wrong password too many times. A scarier prospect, albeit a real one, is that some malicious actor attempted to login into your Apple ID account but failed. Had they succeeded, you would have gotten a message that 'your Apple ID is being used on another device' now.

Apple does a lot to ensure that your Apple ID remains safe. You trust Apple with a lot of your data, including financial data by way of your credit cards associated with Apple ID to make purchases on the App Store and iTunes Store. Therefore, some of the time, Apple preempts issues by proactively locking up your Apple ID or even disabling it. It goes without saying that sometimes it is something so simple as a software error that is believed to have locked up Apple IDs for many users around the world a while ago. It is also entirely possible that it was some malicious actor probing the servers for accounts.

All of these will result in a locked Apple ID that users will have to reset their password to in order to gain access back.

## Part IV: How to Unlock Apple ID on Apple iPhone 11

![apple id webpage](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/10/unlock-apple-id-on-iphone-13-1.jpg)

It is unfortunate you are facing a locked Apple ID. Apple tries its best to make users aware of safety protocols they need to follow to minimize and mitigate such unfortunate occurrences, such as using two-factor authentication, trusted devices, trusted phone numbers, passwords, passcodes, etc. that serve as deterrents to prevent unauthorized access to devices and accounts. Yet, when the unfortunate happens, what to do?

### IV.I: Unlock Apple ID Via Two-Factor Authentication

## Part V: Conclusion

Considering how much the Apple ID is pivotal to our Apple experience, it can be incredibly unnerving to realize that it is locked or disabled, due to any reason. We use our Apple ID for iCloud services on Apple devices, to make purchases on iTunes Store and App Store and payments using Apple Pay. Apple knows this and has checked in place to make sure that only you are in possession of your Apple ID account at all times. It can cause a little hassle at times, since if someone makes multiple failed attempts to gain access to your account, Apple will lock your Apple ID until you can unlock it with proper verifications and reset your password.

## The Easy Way to Remove an Apple ID from Your MacBook For your Apple iPhone 11

Apple has a great ecosystem of devices and services that can be controlled using a single key, your Apple ID. It can be used to login into every Apple service, from Apple Music to FaceTime. However, there are many reasons which can force you to remove your Apple ID from devices like MacBook, iPhone, etc. That makes it important for you to learn **how to remove Apple ID from your MacBook** safely.

![remove apple id from mac](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/01/how-to-remove-apple-id-from-your-mac-1.jpg)

## Part 1: Why Delete Apple ID and iCloud Account?

There are as many reasons to leave the Apple ecosystem as why you should join it. Apple devices are known for security, but it also means that you have less control over their settings. It is also a closed ecosystem that forces you to limit yourself to a specific set of apps and services. Some of the reasons why people might want to **remove their Apple ID from their MacBook** are the following:

- **Switching Platforms:** If you intend to leave Apple devices and move to another platform like Android, it makes sense to delete the Apple ID. Deleting the ID will make it safer for you to sell your old Apple device to others.
- **Privacy Concerns:** While Apple is comparatively secure, your data is still stored on Apple servers. It means the company can still access your data. It will require deleting your Apple ID if you want to delete all personal data from Apple servers.
- **Changing Account:** Getting a new Apple ID means you need to delete your old Apple ID. It will save you the trouble of managing two different IDs with multiple accounts associated with each one.
- **Shared Apple ID:** It is possible that you were sharing your account with your partner or another family member and now want to get your own account. Removing the old account completely and using a new one can be the safest way.

## Part 2: If I Delete Apple ID, Will I Lose Everything?

Deleting your Apple ID is not insignificant because it is your key to the Apple ecosystem, as mentioned above. Though it won't affect your data storage in local device. However, you will no longer be able to access your data store across multiple Apple services like iCloud, Apple Music, FaceTime, iMessage, or other services that require an Apple ID can no longer be used.

You won't be able to purchase or access purchased items from the App Store, iTunes Store, or other Apple services. Remember, deleting your Apple ID is a permanent action and cannot be undone.

## Part 3: How to Remove Apple ID/iCloud Account from Mac with Password?

The process of removing Apple ID from a Mac is easy and quick. Before removing the Apple ID, you need to remember that all the services that require Apple ID will no longer work. To **remove the Apple ID from your** **MacBook**, follow these steps:
