### 1\. Apple ID Signed In on Another Device

One common reason for the Apple ID to appear greyed out is when it is actively signed in on another device. This often happens when users forget to log out of their account on a different Apple device. It leads to a conflict that prevents the smooth functioning of the Apple ID.

### 2\. Incorrect Password Attempts

Multiple [<u>failed attempts at entering the Apple ID password</u>](https://drfone.wondershare.com/icloud/how-to-recover-icloud-password.html) can trigger security measures. It can temporarily disable the account, causing it to grey out. This security measure is created to safeguard the account against unauthorized entry. Nevertheless, it may limit access to the Apple ID in the event of multiple incorrect password entries.
