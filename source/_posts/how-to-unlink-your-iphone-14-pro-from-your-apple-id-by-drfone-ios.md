Privacy is an important concern in today’s digital age. Disconnecting from iCloud can provide a layer of security. It prevents sensitive information like photos, contacts, and documents from being stored in the cloud. This is important if you prefer to maintain complete control over your data.

When you decide to sell or give away your Apple iPhone 14 Pro or iPad, it’s essential to disconnect it from iCloud. Failing to do so could allow the new owner access to your data. Disconnecting ensures your device is wiped clean of your iCloud information, protecting your privacy.

Apple offers a limited amount of free iCloud storage. If you’ve reached or exceeded your storage quota, disconnecting certain devices can help [<u>free up space</u>](https://drfone.wondershare.com/icloud-storage-is-full.html).
