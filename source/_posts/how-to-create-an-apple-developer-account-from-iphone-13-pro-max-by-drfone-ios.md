**Note:** Be wary of using recovery keys! Though they are a very secure and effective method of password recovery, you could easily get permanently locked out of your Apple account. When using a recovery key, you initially need:

1. An Apple ID password.
2. A trusted device that you can easily access.
3. The actual Recovery Key.

Now if you happen to lose any two of the above at the same time, there is no way of recovering your account and you simply have to create a new one.

## Part 7: Using Apple's Two-Factor Authentication (Forgot Apple ID Password)

This is a new account recovery option that is built into iOS 9 and OS X El Capitan. If you have enabled it for your account, you can change or reset Apple password from [iforgot.apple.com](http://iforgot.apple.com/) or from any trusted iPad, iPhone, or iPod touch if you forgot your Apple ID password. The trusted device, however, only works if it has a passcode enabled.

### How to reset Apple password on Your own iPhone

1. Open [iforgot.apple.com](http://iforgot.apple.com/) on any web browser and enter your Apple ID.
2. You can now choose to "Reset from another device," or you can "Use trusted phone number." Choose either option, then click "Continue."

1. It would help if you now waited for prompt requesting access to the trusted device or phone number. Click "Allow." You can now reset your password.

### Recover/reset Apple password on a trusted Apple iOS device

1. On the Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max device, open Settings > iCloud.
2. Select your name, then select "Password & Security."
3. Select "Change Password" and enter your new password. Voila! You're now reunited with your account.

If you can't access the trusted device, you can recover your password on any other iOS device:

### Recover/reset Apple password on any other iOS device

1. Open Settings > iCloud.
2. Select Forgot Apple ID and Password.
3. Follow the given steps to recover your account.

Now, if none of these methods work and you're completely locked out and completely frustrated, then you should [contact Apple](http://support.apple.com/en-us/HT5699) and seek their help to regain access to your account.

## Part 8: Recover lost data (Forgot Apple ID or Apple Password)

If you can't log into your Apple account even after all this hassle, and if you're permanently locked out of your iCloud and Apple accounts, then you can try to [recover iCloud password](https://drfone.wondershare.com/icloud/how-to-recover-icloud-password.html), but your biggest concern should be to save and recover as much data as possible.
