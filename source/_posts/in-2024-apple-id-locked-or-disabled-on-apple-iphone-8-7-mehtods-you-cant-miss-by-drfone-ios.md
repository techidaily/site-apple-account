## Apple ID Locked or Disabled On Apple iPhone 8? 7 Mehtods You Can't-Miss

Apple ID refers to the authentication method available for the Apple iPhone 8 device to compromise users' personal information and settings. The Apple iPhone 8 Apple ID will allow you to store and control data available on the Apple iPhone 8 device; however, you need to re-generate the Apple iPhone 8 passcode if you have forgotten the Apple iPhone 8 passcode. Suppose, if you have forgotten the passcode and entered the wrong passcode six times, your Apple iPhone 8 gets locked or has been disabled. According to your settings, if you have entered the wrong passcode too much time could even make your Apple iPhone 8 delete all the data available.

This article will discuss how you can **unlock Apple ID** and remain secure. If you receive a message that you have entered the wrong passcode or forgotten your passcode, you have to follow some steps to regain access to your Apple Id.
