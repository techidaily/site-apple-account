### 2\. Preventing Fraudulence

If there are unauthorized purchases or suspicious transactions on your ID, Apple may consider locking it to prevent that activity. It happens to protect the user's financial information and to avoid any fraudulent activity from being done on that Apple ID.

### 3\. Using Third-Party Tools

Sometimes, when using third-party tools based on open-source iCloud sources, the Apple ID could get locked. Developers can integrate iCloud features into their applications to provide users with improved accessibility to their iCloud data.

**Step 2:** Enter your Apple ID and select the “**Reset Password**” option.
