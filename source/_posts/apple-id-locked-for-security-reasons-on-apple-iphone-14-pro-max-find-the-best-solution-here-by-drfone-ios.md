## Part 2: 3 Methods To Change the Default Credit Card on Apple Pay

In our exploration of managing your credit card within the Apple ecosystem, we now focus on changing the default credit card linked to your Apple Pay. Apple Pay stands as a robust digital wallet solution, and understanding the process of updating your payment details is crucial for ensuring a secure user experience. Here, we will explore three approaches on **how to change credit card on Apple Pay**:

### Method 1: Change the Default Card on the iPhone

We start by exploring how to change the default credit card on Apple Pay using your Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max. This method is particularly handy for iPhone users who want to ensure their preferred payment card is set as the default option. These are the instructions for setting a card as the default card for Apple Pay:

**Instructions:** On your Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max, access and open the Wallet app. Inside the app, locate the payment card you wish to set as your default. Touch and hold the selected payment card. Drag the card to the forefront, positioning it ahead of your other cards.
