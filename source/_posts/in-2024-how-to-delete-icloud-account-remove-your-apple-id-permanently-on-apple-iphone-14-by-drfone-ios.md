Before you learn the steps on "**how to delete icloud account**," take steps to ensure a smooth transition and prevent the loss of valuable data. Before you permanently remove an iCloud account, ensure you've completed the following:

Backup Your Data

You can [<u>use cloud storage services </u>](https://drfone.wondershare.com/backup-iphone/fix-not-enough-space-on-iphone-to-restore-backup.html) or third-party apps like [<u>Wondershare Dr.Fone</u>](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/drfone-toolkit/) to selectively restore it later.

**Step 2:** You'll then be required to enter the Recovery Key, key it in and hit “Continue”.

<a href="https://zebaoaffiliateprogram.pxf.io/c/5597632/1853659/21526" target="_top" id="1853659"><img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/21526-1853659" border="0" alt="" width="1920" height="750"/></a><img height="0" width="0" src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1853659/21526" style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0" />
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![enter recovery key](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/03/recovery-key-reset.png)

**Note:** Recovery Key is a security code provided to you when the Two-Factor Authentication is first enabled.

**Step 3:** Now, one of your trusted devices will receive a verification code. Enter it on your screen and hit “Next”.

**Step 4:** Upon successful verification, you will be asked to create a new password. Please make a new password now and then make sure to remember it.

That's it you can now make use of this new password to unlock your Apple ID.

## Method 6: A Loophole: DNS Bypass

If you want to unlock **iPhone 13 Apple ID** and don't remember the password**,** you can use this DNS bypass method. But to make use of this method, you need to first factory reset your device and gain access to the “Hello” screen. Here's how you can make use of this method.

**Step 1:** Firstly, you need to reboot your device into Recovery Mode. Then, launch iTunes and plug it in the computer. Now, iTunes will detect your device in recovery mode. Hit on Restore iPhone and wait for the process to complete.

**Step 2:** Your device will restart to the “Hello” screen upon completion. From the menu, choose language and country.

**Step 3:** Tap on “Proceed” to get into the Wi-Fi settings page.

**Step 4:** Now click on the “i” icon bonded by a circle next to Wi-Fi.

![click i icon](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/03/dns-bypass-1.png)

**Note:** In case, you are already connected to a Wi-Fi network, ensure to click on it first and then tap on “Forget This Network” to have the “i” icon visible.

**Step 5:** Now, when you tap on the “i” icon next to any Wi-Fi network (not connected), you need to look for the “Configure DNS” server option. Click on it and then select “Manual”, then click “Add Server.”

![configure dns server](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/03/dns-bypass-2.png)

You have to select the DNS from the option available according to your region.

- USA/North America: 104.154.51.7
- Europe: 104.155.28.90
- Asia: 104.155.220.58
- Other areas: 78.109.17.60

**Step 6:** Now, save the settings, return to the connection page and connect to your Wi-Fi.

**Step 7:** You need to wait for your device to get connected with the iCloud DNS bypass server automatically.

![iclouddnsbypass home](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/03/dns-bypass-3.png)

**Step 8:** Once you are connected to the DNS server successfully, you can then use apps and features available on your Apple iPhone 14 in an alternative way.
