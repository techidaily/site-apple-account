- **Step 2:** Click the lock icon and enter your admin password. Click the **+** or **Add User…** button to add a new user, selecting **Administrator** as the account type. Log in to the new account and check if the issue persists.

### Update Your iOS or macOS Software

Outdated operating systems often contribute to connectivity issues. Ensure your iOS or macOS software is up to date by [<u>checking for available updates</u>](https://drfone.wondershare.com/ios-upgrade/how-to-upgrade-with-firmware-files.html). Here's how.

- **For iOS**: Go to **Settings**, tap **General**, and select **SoftwareUpdate**.

Download and install any available updates.

### Boot macOS in Safe Mode

Booting your Mac in [<u> Safe Mode</u>](https://drfone.wondershare.com/android-tips/safe-mode-in-android.html) is another approach to troubleshooting. The mode disables unnecessary processes, allowing you to identify and resolve potential conflicts causing the connection error. To put your Mac into safe mode, restart it and hold down the **Shift** key. Release it when the Apple logo appears.

### Restart Your Apple Device

A classic yet effective solution is to restart your Apple device. This simple action refreshes system processes and can resolve various connectivity issues. Power off your device and turn it back on to initiate a clean start.

### Sign Out and Sign Back Into Your Apple ID Account

Temporarily [<u>signing out of your Apple ID account</u>](https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/how-to-sign-out-of-apple-id-without-password.html) and then signing back in can be a virtual reset. The process refreshes the connection and addresses potential authentication issues, resolving the error.

- **On iOS**: Go to **Settings**, tap your Apple ID, and choose **SignOut**. Sign in again.

![sign in screen on iphone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/11/error-connecting-to-apple-id-07.jpg)

- **On macOS**: Open **SystemPreferences**, select **Apple** **ID,** and click **Sign** **Out**. Sign in again.

### Reset Your Apple ID Password

Security concerns related to compromised credentials can contribute to the connection problem. If in doubt, initiate a password reset for your Apple ID. It not only enhances account security but also addresses authentication errors. Here's how.

### Disable VPN

If you use a Virtual Private Network (VPN), consider temporarily disabling it. VPNs can sometimes interfere with the connection to Apple's servers, causing the error. Disabling the VPN allows you to test whether it's the source of the problem.

### Adjust Date and Time Settings Automatically

Inaccurate date and time settings on your device can lead to authentication failures. Ensure your device's date and time are accurate and set to update automatically. This prevents synchronization issues with the Apple ID server.
