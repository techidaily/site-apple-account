## Apple ID Locked or Disabled On Apple iPhone 12 Pro? 7 Mehtods You Can't-Miss

Apple ID refers to the authentication method available for the Apple iPhone 12 Pro device to compromise users' personal information and settings. The Apple iPhone 12 Pro Apple ID will allow you to store and control data available on the Apple iPhone 12 Pro device; however, you need to re-generate the Apple iPhone 12 Pro passcode if you have forgotten the Apple iPhone 12 Pro passcode. Suppose, if you have forgotten the passcode and entered the wrong passcode six times, your Apple iPhone 12 Pro gets locked or has been disabled. According to your settings, if you have entered the wrong passcode too much time could even make your Apple iPhone 12 Pro delete all the data available.

This article will discuss how you can **unlock Apple ID** and remain secure. If you receive a message that you have entered the wrong passcode or forgotten your passcode, you have to follow some steps to regain access to your Apple Id.

![apple id locked](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/03/apple-id-locked.png)

Some of the reasons causing your Apple ID locked or disabled are listed below:

- If you have entered the wrong passcode or security question too many times in a row, Apple ID gets locked. ( Avoid entering the incorrect password more than 3 times)
