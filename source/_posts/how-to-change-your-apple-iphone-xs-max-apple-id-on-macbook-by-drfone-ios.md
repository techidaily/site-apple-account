## Part 4. Is “Your account has been disabled in the App Store and iTunes” the same as “Apple ID disabled”?

No. The error message “Your account has been disabled in the App Store and iTunes” differs from “Apple ID disabled”. You will primarily see the “Your account has been disabled in the App Store and iTunes” when you try to access content in the App Store. On the other hand, you may see the message “Apple ID disabled” when you enter the Apple ID and password to [bypass the iCloud Activation Lock screen](https://drfone.wondershare.com/icloud/bypass-icloud-activation.html).

After you see these errors, you will not be able to access some of the features and apps that require your Apple ID for access.
