## Part 6: Using Apple's Two-step Verification (Forgot Apple Password)

2. Click the "Enter your Apple ID" option and type in your Apple ID to launch the recovery process.

**Note:** Be wary of using recovery keys! Though they are a very secure and effective method of password recovery, you could easily get permanently locked out of your Apple account. When using a recovery key, you initially need:

1. An Apple ID password.
2. A trusted device that you can easily access.
