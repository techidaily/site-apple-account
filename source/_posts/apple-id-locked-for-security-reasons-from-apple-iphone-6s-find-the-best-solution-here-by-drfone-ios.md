## Apple ID Locked for Security Reasons On Apple iPhone 6s? Find the Best Solution Here

Apple ID is the main functional unit in the smooth and secure operation of Apple devices. This ID is the gateway towards many services, including iCloud, App Store, and more.

Has **your Apple ID been locked for security reasons**, and is this problem creating some tension for you? Before we move further towards its solutions, it's essential to know the reasons that lead to these problems. Some of them are explained below in a comprehensive manner:

### 1\. Incorrect Attempts

Apple locks your Apple ID mainly when you or someone else has entered the password incorrectly multiple times. This is one of the most common reasons, and mostly, this happens by the original users themselves unintentionally.

### 2\. Preventing Fraudulence

If there are unauthorized purchases or suspicious transactions on your ID, Apple may consider locking it to prevent that activity. It happens to protect the user's financial information and to avoid any fraudulent activity from being done on that Apple ID.

Sometimes, when using third-party tools based on open-source iCloud sources, the Apple ID could get locked. Developers can integrate iCloud features into their applications to provide users with improved accessibility to their iCloud data.

### 4\. Security Breach Reasons

The ID can also get locked when Apple senses a potential security breach, which could lead to the exposure of your credentials. It may occur when someone tries to hack your ID to get some information, especially when it is being used in multiple areas.

### 5\. Incorrect Security Questions

It may be due to the security questions you or someone else has entered incorrectly too many times. This is another common reason because, most often, the security questions are forgotten by the user. Ultimately, this leads to your Apple ID being locked for security reasons.

## Part 1: When Does the Apple Verification ID Failed Prompt Appear?

Before diving into solutions, it’s essential to understand the various scenarios that can trigger the “**Apple Verification ID Failed**” prompt. Recognizing the cause of the problem is the first step toward the right fix. Let’s explore the common reasons you might encounter this issue:

### Wrong Password Input

One of the most straightforward reasons for a failed verification is entering the wrong password. This could be a simple typing error or misremembering your password. Repeated wrong attempts can also lead to your account being temporarily disabled as a security measure.

### Apple Server Issues

At times, the problem may not be on your end. Apple’s servers can experience downtime or technical glitches like any other online service. During such instances, verification processes might fail, as the server cannot authenticate your credentials.

![apple server status page](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/apple-id-verification-not-working-02.jpg)

### Slow Internet or Intermittent Connection

A stable and reliable internet connection is improtant for the verification process. If your internet is slow or experiencing intermittent connectivity, it can disrupt the communication between your device and Apple’s servers, leading to verification failure.

### Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) Issues

Apple’s two-factor authentication provides an extra layer of security. However, it can also be a source of problems. If there’s a delay in receiving the 2FA code or if [<u>2FA fails to work</u>](https://drfone.wondershare.com/android-issue/authentication-error.html), you won’t be able to complete the verification process. This could be due to network issues or, sometimes, glitches within the 2FA system itself.

### Suspicious Activity

Apple takes your security seriously. If there’s any unusual activity detected on your account, such as login attempts from unfamiliar locations or devices, Apple might lock your account as a precaution. This can trigger the verification failed prompt as the system seeks to protect your account from potential unauthorized access.

By understanding these scenarios, you can diagnose better why you’re facing the issue of **Apple verification ID not working**. In the following sections, we will explore solutions tailored to these specific problems, helping you regain access to your account efficiently.

## Part 2: How To Fix Apple ID Verification Failed

Sometimes, simply signing out and back into your Apple ID can resolve verification issues. Navigate to **Settings**, tap your name at the top, scroll down, and select **Sign Out**. After signing out, sign back in and check if the issue persists.

### Method 5: Disabling VPN

If you’re using a VPN, it can sometimes cause issues with Apple ID verification. Try disabling your VPN from the **Settings** or the VPN app you’re using, and then attempt the verification process again.

### Method 6: Updating to the Latest iOS

Running an outdated iOS version can cause compatibility issues. Go to **Settings**, select **General**, and tap on **Software Update**. If an update is available, download and install it to ensure your device is up-to-date.

### Method 7: Checking Apple Server Status and Trying Again Later

Sometimes, the problem is on Apple’s end. Check the Apple System Status page to see if there are any issues with their servers. If there are, it’s best to wait and try the verification process later.

By following these methods, you should be able to resolve the “Apple ID Verification Failed” issue and regain full access to your Apple ID functionalities.
