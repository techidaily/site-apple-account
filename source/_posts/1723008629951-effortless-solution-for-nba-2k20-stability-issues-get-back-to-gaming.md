Below are the minimum and recommended system requirements for DayZ:

#### The minimum system requirements for DayZ

### Fix 6: Add DayZ as an exception to your third-party antivirus application

 This issue may also be triggered by your third-party antivirus application. Since the third-party antivirus application hooks very deep into your system, it may interfere with DayZ.

2. **Right-click** DayZ and select **Delete Local Content…** . to uninstall the game.
