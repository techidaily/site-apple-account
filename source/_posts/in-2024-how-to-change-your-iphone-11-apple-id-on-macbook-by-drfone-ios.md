To begin, download the Dr.Fone Toolkit from the program’s main website. Install the toolkit onto your computer. Open it after successful installation and then choose “Screen Unlock” from the main screen.

- **Step 2: Choose to Remove Apple ID**

On the next screen, you should see three options. Choose “Remove Apple ID” since we want to remove the Apple ID from the Apple iPhone 11 device.

- **Step 3: Connect the iOS Device**

Connect the iOS device to the computer using its lightning cable. Then enter the Apple iPhone 11 device’s passcode and, when prompted, tap “Trust” to allow the computer to detect the Apple iPhone 11 device. The program should detect the Apple iPhone 11 device and display information about it. Then click “Unlock Now”.

- **Step 4: Apple ID Removal will Begin**

Dr.Fone will immediately begin removing the Apple ID from the Apple iPhone 11 device. You should see a progress bar indicating how long the process will take. Ordinarily, the removal should take just a few seconds. When the process is complete, you will see a notification on the screen letting you know that the Apple ID has been removed.

You should then be able to sign in to another Apple ID or create a new Apple ID and password to use on the Apple iPhone 11 device.
