These messages can come in the form of "Your account has been disabled in the App Store and iTunes." Over observing this prompt message, it has been discovered that the assorted message is not related to the other common message of "This Apple ID has been disabled for security reasons."

Normally, you may have some billing issues that are prevailing over an unpaid iTunes or App Store order.
