## Part 2: How to get rid of someone’s Apple ID off iPhone with the previous owner’s help?

Signing out of the Apple ID on your Apple iPhone 15 Plus is very easy if you are in contact with the previous owner. There are a few methods that are available for understanding how to remove the Apple ID from the Apple iPhone 15 Plus with their help.

### 1st Method

- The associated person needs to sign themselves into icloud.com and the Apple iPhone 15 Plus from their account. After signing in, they can easily access the Apple iPhone 15 Plus by hitting "Find iPhone."
- After successfully finding the iPhone, they need to click "All Devices," followed by the Apple iPhone 15 Plus from which the account is to be removed and select "Erase iPhone."

### 2nd Method

There is another alternative method available to check if the previous owner has considerable trust in you. They would have to share their Apple ID credentials, which then can be easily removed by following the steps while using the same iPhone.

### 3rd Method

- In cases where the previous account is not activated, users can apply this method for iPhone models later than iPhone 6S.
- Connect with the desktop and open iTunes on it. Initiate a force restart by holding down the sleep button and volume down button for 10 seconds.
- Release the Sleep button and keep a hold of the volume down button for another 10 seconds.
- The screen on the Apple iPhone 15 Plus should be black. Following this, a message would appear on the desktop screen showing an iPhone in recovery mode.
- By clicking "Ok," the restoration of the Apple iPhone 15 Plus shall start.
