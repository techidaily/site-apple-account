### Tip 3. Recover Your Apple ID via Apple (Reset Password)

If you have forgotten your Apple device’s password, it’s recommended not to input your password more than one time. It would lead to a 24-hour shutdown. It cannot be lifted even if you know your password, so proceed wisely. The recommended solution instead is to reset your password.

Here are the steps to reset the password for any of your Apple devices, provided they are in your trusted devices’ list.

**Step 1.** Go to Settings on your Apple device and tap your name.

**Step 2.** Now, go to Password & Security and then Change passcode.

**Step 3.** If your Apple device is signed in to iCloud, you will be required to enter a password.

**Step 4.** Enter the iCloud password and then set a new code for your device.
