## Apple ID Locked or Disabled On Apple iPhone 14 Pro? 7 Mehtods You Can't-Miss

Apple ID refers to the authentication method available for the Apple iPhone 14 Pro device to compromise users' personal information and settings.

Suppose, if you have forgotten the passcode and entered the wrong passcode six times, your Apple iPhone 14 Pro gets locked or has been disabled. According to your settings, if you have entered the wrong passcode too much time could even make your Apple iPhone 14 Pro delete all the data available.
