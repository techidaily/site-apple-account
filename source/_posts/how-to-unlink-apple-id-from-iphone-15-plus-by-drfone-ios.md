Apple provides many exciting features in its products, including the AirTag feature on iPhone devices. However, after enabling the function, many iPhone users forget to remove it from the FindMy app ahead of time. Therefore, if you are selling or resetting the Apple iPhone 15 Plus device, you need to **remove AirTag from Apple ID** to be usable later.

If someone removes the AirTag without resetting it while operating in the Bluetooth range, deleting AirTag ownership will require manually breaking the Apple iPhone 15 Plus device apart and further configuration.

Remove this connection from the Apple ID account with simple steps first-hand to avoid that. Read on to know the steps involved in this process directly or with the best software alternative.

## Part 1. What Exactly Does an AirTag Do?

Before discussing **how to remove AirTag from Apple ID,** you should know better about the function itself. The AirTag feature is available for iOS devices. Therefore, one can register the AirTag process with the Apple ID you are utilizing on your smartphone.

Apple users can attach the AirTag to different objects like backpacks or keychains. This makes it simple to find these objects later in case they get misplaced or lost through the Find My app on the iPhone.

Users can add their AirTag to one Apple ID account, so you cannot access this from the Find My app via other accounts. In case of loss, you must remove the AirTag from your device entirely.
