Many people use 2FA globally to protect their personal information and devices from hackers and unauthorized access.

3. **Encouraging Security Awareness:** To make Apple users more security conscious, Apple has made it difficult on purpose to remove 2FA. It helps users to be more confident in Apple services and products.
4. **Minimizing Mistakenly Steps:** If users mistakenly remove the 2FA, their accounts and devices are at risk of being accessed without proper authentication. To avoid such an issue, the deactivation option of 2FA is removed.

Besides all these reasons, there is still some good news for those who want to **remove the two-factor authentication iPhone** to use other security options. The good news is that Apple allows users to remove 2FA for a limited time after activation.
