## Part 4: Erase an iPhone Without Apple ID via Activation Lock Support Request

To start this request, follow these steps:

- **Step 1:** Head to Apple's Activation Lock support page. (al-support.apple.com)
- **Step 2:** Scroll down the page, select the agreement checkbox, click **Continue**, and it will redirect you to a new page.
