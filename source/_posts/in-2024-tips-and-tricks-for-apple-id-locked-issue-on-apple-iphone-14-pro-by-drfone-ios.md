## 3 Ways of How to Get Someone's Apple ID Off Apple iPhone 14 Pro without Password

iPhone has its unique system of iCloud and Apple ID that allows high privacy and security for users. It is responsible for keeping an updated version of all the applications that are present within the iPhone. You might have encountered a second-hand iPhone once in your life, which has a pre-stored Apple ID belonging to another user. You might be left with more problems while using your Apple iPhone 14 Pro under complicated circumstances where users do not have the username or password to the Apple ID that is related to the previous user.

There are several ways to get rid of someone else's Apple ID without any credentials. This article will describe the methods of how to get someone's Apple ID off the Apple iPhone 14 Pro without a password or any other credential.
