How To Unlink Apple Watch From Apple ID if You Have Your Apple iPhone 7?

Follow the unpairing process on the paired Apple iPhone 7 to remove the Activation Lock and erase your Apple Watch's content and settings.

- **Step 1:** Check to ensure your Apple Watch and iPhone are close.
- **Step 2:** Launch the **Watch** application on your Apple iPhone 7 and go to the **My Watch** tab.
- **Step 3:** Tap **All Watches** in the upper left corner.

- **Step 8:** Tap **Unpair** to confirm your action.

How To Unlink Apple Watch From Apple ID Without Your Apple iPhone 7?

You can erase your Apple Watch without the paired iPhone, but the Activation Lock will still be active. But, if you give away your Apple Watch without turning off the Activation Lock, the person you give it to cannot use it. They'll have to enter your Apple ID and password to turn off the Activation Lock and use it with a new iPhone.

- **Step 1:** Open the **Settings** app on your Apple Watch.
- **Step 2:** Go to **General** > **Reset**, tap **Erase All Content and Settings**. Then, enter your password, if needed.
