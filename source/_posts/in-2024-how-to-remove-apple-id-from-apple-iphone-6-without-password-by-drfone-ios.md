How To Unlink Apple Watch From Apple ID Without Your Apple iPhone 6?

You can erase your Apple Watch without the paired iPhone, but the Activation Lock will still be active.

They'll have to enter your Apple ID and password to turn off the Activation Lock and use it with a new iPhone.

- **Step 1:** Open the **Settings** app on your Apple Watch.
- **Step 2:** Go to **General** > **Reset**, tap **Erase All Content and Settings**. Then, enter your password, if needed.
