It is also a closed ecosystem that forces you to limit yourself to a specific set of apps and services. Some of the reasons why people might want to **remove their Apple ID from their MacBook** are the following:

- **Switching Platforms:** If you intend to leave Apple devices and move to another platform like Android, it makes sense to delete the Apple ID. Deleting the ID will make it safer for you to sell your old Apple device to others.
- **Privacy Concerns:** While Apple is comparatively secure, your data is still stored on Apple servers. It means the company can still access your data. It will require deleting your Apple ID if you want to delete all personal data from Apple servers.
- **Changing Account:** Getting a new Apple ID means you need to delete your old Apple ID. It will save you the trouble of managing two different IDs with multiple accounts associated with each one.
- **Shared Apple ID:** It is possible that you were sharing your account with your partner or another family member and now want to get your own account. Removing the old account completely and using a new one can be the safest way.

## Part 2: If I Delete Apple ID, Will I Lose Everything?

Deleting your Apple ID is not insignificant because it is your key to the Apple ecosystem, as mentioned above. Though it won't affect your data storage in local device. However, you will no longer be able to access your data store across multiple Apple services like iCloud, Apple Music, FaceTime, iMessage, or other services that require an Apple ID can no longer be used.

You won't be able to purchase or access purchased items from the App Store, iTunes Store, or other Apple services. Remember, deleting your Apple ID is a permanent action and cannot be undone.

## Part 3: How to Remove Apple ID/iCloud Account from Mac with Password?
