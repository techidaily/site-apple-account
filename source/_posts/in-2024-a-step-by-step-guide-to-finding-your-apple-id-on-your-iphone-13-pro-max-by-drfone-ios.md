### 2\. App Store and iTunes Purchases

You can access a distinct collection of applications, music, films, and books by creating or logging in with a different Apple ID. This proves especially beneficial when considering a change of region. It also helps when sharing your MacBook with family members, each of whom has their individual Apple ID.

### 3\. iCloud Storage

Your Apple ID is closely linked with iCloud, Apple's cloud storage service. Changing your Apple ID allows you to gain access to an alternative iCloud account with its dedicated storage capacity. This can be advantageous when you require additional storage or wish to keep your data separate from a previous account.

### 4\. Privacy and Security Settings

Frequently updating your Apple ID can enhance your online privacy and security. It enhances the challenge for unauthorized parties to acquire your personal information. This, consequently, reduces the risk of accessing your MacBook's sensitive information.

## Bonus Part: How To Fix Unable To Logout (Change) the Old Apple ID on Mac

Although changing your Apple ID on your Mac is usually a swift procedure, there may be instances where you find it challenging. It's essential to resolve this matter promptly. The reason is that many essential procedures and services are directly linked to your Apple ID. Here are some common reasons why you might face difficulty logging out of the old Apple ID and their solutions:

### 1\. Ongoing iCloud Backup

While the data is backed up on the iCloud from your Mac, you cannot log out from the Apple ID. It is because, while the data is being uploaded, logging out of Apple ID is restricted to ensure that data is not lost during the process.

#### Solution

Wait for the iCloud backup to complete before attempting to log out. You can access the backup information through “iCloud” within your Apple ID settings of System Settings. Here, tap “iCloud Drive” and stop syncing to stop the ongoing iCloud backup process.
