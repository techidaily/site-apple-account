## Part 1. What Exactly Does an AirTag Do?

Before discussing **how to remove AirTag from Apple ID,** you should know better about the function itself. The AirTag feature is available for iOS devices. Therefore, one can register the AirTag process with the Apple ID you are utilizing on your smartphone.
