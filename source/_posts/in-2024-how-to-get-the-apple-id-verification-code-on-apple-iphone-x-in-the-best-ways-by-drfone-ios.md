To begin, download the Dr.Fone Toolkit from the program’s main website. Install the toolkit onto your computer. Open it after successful installation and then choose “Screen Unlock” from the main screen.

- **Step 2: Choose to Remove Apple ID**

On the next screen, you should see three options. Choose “Remove Apple ID” since we want to remove the Apple ID from the Apple iPhone X device.

- **Step 3: Connect the iOS Device**

Connect the iOS device to the computer using its lightning cable. Then enter the Apple iPhone X device’s passcode and, when prompted, tap “Trust” to allow the computer to detect the Apple iPhone X device. The program should detect the Apple iPhone X device and display information about it. Then click “Unlock Now”.
