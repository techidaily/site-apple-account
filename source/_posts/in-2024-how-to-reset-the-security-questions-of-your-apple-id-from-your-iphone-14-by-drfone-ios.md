## Part 4: Erase an iPhone Without Apple ID via Activation Lock Support Request

The proof should show the serial number of the iPhone, [<u>IMEI</u>](https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/unlock-phone-free-with-imei-number.html), or MEID. Once Apple unlocks the Activation Lock on your Apple iPhone 14, your Apple iPhone 14 contents will be permanently erased. Also, note that if you restore your Apple iPhone 14 from a local backup, the Activation Lock will re-enable.

To start this request, follow these steps:

- **Step 1:** Head to Apple's Activation Lock support page. (al-support.apple.com)
- **Step 2:** Scroll down the page, select the agreement checkbox, click **Continue**, and it will redirect you to a new page.
