While you understand the basic reasons that lead you to the fact that Dr. Fone is the most appropriate choice to unlock your disabled Apple Account, the following steps explain the guide that would help you in unlocking your device with ease.

**Step 1: Connect Devices and Launch**

Initially, it is significant to download the platform and install it by following all the on-screen instructions effectively. Following this, you need to launch the platform and connect your Apple device via a USB connection.

**Step 2: Select Screen Unlock**

With the home window on your front, you are required to tap on the 'Screen Unlock' tool from the list of options to open a new screen. On the new screen, you are required to select the last option of "Unlock Apple ID" to initiate the process.

**Step 3: Trust the Computer and Access Device Settings**

Over the Apple Device, you need to select the option of “Trust” over the prompt that is received on the phone. Following this, you need to open the “Settings” of your device and initiate a reboot of your Apple device.

**Step 4: Device Unlocks**

The unlocking process immediately starts, and the platform executes the complete process automatically. A prompt message appears on the desktop showing the completion of the task. The device is now unlocked successfully.

### Unlock disabled Apple account using Apple's verification

The other method that can be effectively tested is Apple's verification that would allow us to easily topple off all barriers that are involved in the process. To effectively unlock your disabled Apple Account using Apple's verification process, you need to follow the steps described in detail.

**Step 1: Open iForgot Website**

You need to open the iForgot website to test the verification process. As you open the platform, provide the appropriate credentials over which your Apple device is operating. This is referred to as your Apple ID that has been used for the Apple iPhone 6 device.

**Step 3: Use the Verification Code**

The platform will send a verification code that would allow you to unlock your device with the Recovery Key that is offered. Tap on "Unable to access your \[device\]"? to allow the platform to send a six-digit verification to the phone number that is attached to the Apple ID. You can simply use it along with the Apple ID password to unlock your account.
