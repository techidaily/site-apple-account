As your device is in Recovery Mode, Dr.Fone will detect its model. You need to choose the system version and click “Start” to download it. Once it has been downloaded and verified, hit “Unlock Now.” A warning prompt will appear about expected data loss. Put the “000000” PIN in the warning box and click “Unlock.” This will start the Apple ID unlock process.
