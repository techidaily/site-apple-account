### Account Recovery (iForgot)

Visit iforgot.apple.com, where you can initiate the account recovery process. Once on the website, you'll have to enter your Apple ID.

### Two-Factor Authentication

If you have [<u>two-factor authentication</u>](https://drfone.wondershare.com/remove-apple-account/remove-apple-two-factor-authentication.html) enabled for your Apple ID, you can use your trusted device or the recovery key to unlock your account. Here's how.

- **Step 1**: On your Apple iPhone 12 Pro, go to **Settings.** Next**,** tap on your name at the top. Tap **Password** **& Security** > **Account** **Recovery** > **Recovery** **Key**.

- **Step 2**: Turn on **Recovery** **Key** and enter your passcode. Write down your recovery key and confirm by entering it once more. You can now **unlock your Apple ID** with the recovery key generated.

**Note**

- **Step 2:** Enter your device passcode and follow the prompts to create a new password. Make sure it's unique and secure to prevent future lockouts.

### Email Verification

If you've forgotten your Apple ID password, you can [<u>initiate a password reset</u>](https://drfone.wondershare.com/reset-iphone/how-to-reset-iphone-password.html) via email. Here's how to do it on iPhone/iPad or Mac.
