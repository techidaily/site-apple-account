### Method 3. Use DNS bypass

Bypassing DNS Server is one more way for you if you're searching for simple methods for eliminating Activation Lock without the past user. Note that this DNS strategy can bypass the iCloud lock for a brief time. Here's how:

**Step 1.** Open your iPad and explore the "Choose a Wi-Fi Network" page.

**Step 2.** Presently, press the Home button and select Wi-Fi settings. Presently, tap the "I" symbol right behind your Wi-Fi network. It will show the properties of the Wi-Fi.

**Step 3.** Select "Configure DNS" and set it as indicated by your region:

![dns bypass](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/remove-activation-lock-without-previous-owner-ipad-2.jpg)

- USA: 104.154.51.7
- South America: 35.199.88.219
- Europe: 104.155.28.90
- Asia: 104.155.220.58
- Australia and Oceania: 35.189.47.23
- Other Continents: 78.100.17.60

**Step 4.** From that point forward, return to the Wi-Fi page.

**Step 5.** Presently, click over and again on “Next” and “Back” and hold on until the iPad connects with your area's iCloud DNS bypass server.

### Method 4. Local Apple Support

Following the techniques above, you can try reaching Apple's local service when you can't remove the Activation Lock. However, you need to provide the following things:

- iPad serial number
- Buying receipt

When they confirm you own the iOS iPad legitimately, they will help you further by unlocking your iPad.

## Part 2: How to Reset iPad without Passcode?

### 1\. Reset iPad by Computer

- Connect your iPad to a computer. Press and hold the Power button + Home button (if your iPad has a Home button). Otherwise, press and hold the Power button + either Volume button (if your iPad doesn't have a Home button) until you see the Recovery Mode screen.
- On your Macintosh, find the connected iPad.
- Tap Restore and trust that the process will end.
- Set up your iPad and restore the factory default settings without a password.

### 2\. Reset it by Find My

- Go to iCloud.com, and sign in with your Apple ID and password.
- Click on the Find \[device\] symbol in the menu.
- Select your iPad from the list of all the connected devices.
- Select Erase iPad.
- Follow the prompts for **iPad locked to owner reset**.

### 3\. Reset with iTunes

- Open the iTunes application or website.
- Connect your iPad to your PC with a connector. Enter your password whenever required.
- Click on the iPad symbol in the upper-left corner.
- Select Summary in the left section.
- Click Restore iPad and then click the Restore button to confirm and reset the **iPad locked to the owner**.
