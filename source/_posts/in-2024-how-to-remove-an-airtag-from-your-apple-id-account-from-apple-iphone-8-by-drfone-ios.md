- Step 2: Enable the Recovery Mode on Your Apple iPhone 8

Once the Apple iPhone 8 is connected, hit “Unlock Now” and proceed to confirm that your device has a screen lock configured and 2FA is enabled. These are necessary for the removal of Apple ID, so set them up if you haven't already. Afterward, activate Recovery Mode following the on-screen instructions on your device.

- Step 3: Unlock the Apple ID From Your Apple iPhone 8

As your device is in Recovery Mode, Dr.Fone will detect its model. You need to choose the system version and click “Start” to download it. Once it has been downloaded and verified, hit “Unlock Now.” A warning prompt will appear about expected data loss. Put the “000000” PIN in the warning box and click “Unlock.” This will start the Apple ID unlock process.
