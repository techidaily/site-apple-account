You would use the Find My Devices utility of the service to remove the ID. Here are the steps:

**Step 1.** Visit the iCloud website using your favorite browser. Once you are there, sign in through your Apple ID.

**Step 2.** Select the “Find iPhone” option to initiate removing the Apple ID from the Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max permanently.

**Step 3.** There will be an option in front of you with the title “My Devices” select it.

**Step 4.** You will be presented with four options, select “Remove from Account,” and the Apple ID of the previous owner will no longer plague the iPhone.
