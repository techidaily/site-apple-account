## Apple ID Locked or Disabled On Apple iPhone 6s? 7 Mehtods You Can't-Miss

Suppose, if you have forgotten the passcode and entered the wrong passcode six times, your Apple iPhone 6s gets locked or has been disabled. According to your settings, if you have entered the wrong passcode too much time could even make your Apple iPhone 6s delete all the data available.

This article will discuss how you can **unlock Apple ID** and remain secure. If you receive a message that you have entered the wrong passcode or forgotten your passcode, you have to follow some steps to regain access to your Apple Id.
