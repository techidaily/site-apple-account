In our exploration of managing your credit card within the Apple ecosystem, we now focus on changing the default credit card linked to your Apple Pay. Apple Pay stands as a robust digital wallet solution, and understanding the process of updating your payment details is crucial for ensuring a secure user experience. Here, we will explore three approaches on **how to change credit card on Apple Pay**:

### Method 1: Change the Default Card on the iPhone
