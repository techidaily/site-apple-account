## Part 1. What happens if I remove a device from my iCloud?

If you look over the operation of iCloud service for any Apple device, the exemption of the service will lead you into losing access from a service that offers you a backing up feature along with synchronization. Furthermore, this will also affect the Find My service, leading you to make your device theft evasive. The removal of the Find My service makes it possible for thieves to wipe off data of the Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max device and have it sold across the market, with no chances of retrieval. Despite the removal of the iCloud service from your device, it will function normally; however, the security and tranquility offered by the Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max device would not remain intact with its exemption. The iCloud account that has been removed will keep the data that has been previously stored in it by the Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max device backup, but it would not accept any new addition.

Whenever you consider removing the iCloud backup from the Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max device, it prompts over keeping the data on your device, if necessary. All the data that is not selected by the user will be removed from the iPhone.
