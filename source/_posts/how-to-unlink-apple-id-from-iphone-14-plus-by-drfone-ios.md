### 1\. Ongoing iCloud Backup

While the data is backed up on the iCloud from your Mac, you cannot log out from the Apple ID. It is because, while the data is being uploaded, logging out of Apple ID is restricted to ensure that data is not lost during the process.

#### Solution

Wait for the iCloud backup to complete before attempting to log out. You can access the backup information through “iCloud” within your Apple ID settings of System Settings. Here, tap “iCloud Drive” and stop syncing to stop the ongoing iCloud backup process.

### Boot macOS in Safe Mode

Booting your Mac in [<u> Safe Mode</u>](https://drfone.wondershare.com/android-tips/safe-mode-in-android.html) is another approach to troubleshooting. The mode disables unnecessary processes, allowing you to identify and resolve potential conflicts causing the connection error. To put your Mac into safe mode, restart it and hold down the **Shift** key. Release it when the Apple logo appears.

### Reset Your Apple ID Password

Security concerns related to compromised credentials can contribute to the connection problem. If in doubt, initiate a password reset for your Apple ID. It not only enhances account security but also addresses authentication errors. Here's how.

### Disable VPN

If you use a Virtual Private Network (VPN), consider temporarily disabling it. VPNs can sometimes interfere with the connection to Apple's servers, causing the error. Disabling the VPN allows you to test whether it's the source of the problem.

### Adjust Date and Time Settings Automatically

Inaccurate date and time settings on your device can lead to authentication failures. Ensure your device's date and time are accurate and set to update automatically. This prevents synchronization issues with the Apple ID server.
