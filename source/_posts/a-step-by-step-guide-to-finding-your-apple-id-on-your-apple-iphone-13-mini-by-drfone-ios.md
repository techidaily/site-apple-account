Use the following guide to get the verification code from your Mac:

- **Step 1.** Navigate to "System Settings" on your Mac through the Dock or Apple menu. There, select Apple ID/your name from the left panel and click "Sign-In & Security."
- **Step 2.** Within the Sign-In & Security settings, tap "Two-Factor Authentication." Follow it by clicking "Get a Verification Code," and a code will be displayed for your use.
