## How to Fix Locked Apple ID on Apple iPhone 12 Pro

Part of why you own and use Apple devices is the reliability of the Apple iPhone 12 Pro devices and the ease of using them. This starts with the quality of hardware and the synergy with the software that runs the hardware, and the user experience you get. Apple puts great emphasis on this, and rightly so, for this is one of the keys defining and differentiating factors for people to choose Apple's iOS over Google's Android. Like with all good things in life, sometimes, a spanner is put in the works that bring your smooth-sailing life to an abrupt halt. With smartphones playing pivotal roles in our lives today, from payments to internet experiences to getting work done to stay in touch with people, anything that stops us from using our smartphone or endangers that experience is a cause for worry. A locked Apple ID is one such thing. It does not happen frequently, in fact, most users will never experience a locked Apple ID, but for the ones who are fortunate enough to have such a rare experience in life, help is at hand. All you need to do is relax and read on. By the end of it, you will have an unlocked Apple ID and you can go back to cruising.

## Part I: Difference Between Activation Lock and Locked Apple ID

Apple being Apple, does a lot to make sure that users get the smoothest experience possible when interacting with their Apple products, both hardware, and software. Yet, sometimes, the messaging gets confusing, and people are not sure what is what. One such thing is the difference between iCloud Activation Lock and Apple ID Lock. While people are more likely to encounter Activation Lock and less likely to encounter Apple ID Lock, they are often confused when they encounter Apple ID Lock and struggle to figure out what that means and how to resolve the issue.

Activation Lock is when your supported Apple device is locked for a number of reasons. The most common reason is a stolen device that was locked by its owner, however, there are other perfectly valid reasons such as an outgoing employee forgetting to sign out and erase their Apple device before submitting it back. The IT department would not be able to reset that device without turning off Find My Apple iPhone 12 Pro and Activation Lock on the Apple iPhone 12 Pro device.

A locked Apple ID usually happens when the user has forgotten their password to their Apple ID account and attempts to figure out the password have been unsuccessful. Sometimes, Apple ID gets locked automatically under some conditions, and that requires users to reset their password to gain access. A locked Apple ID does not mean that your device is locked for your use. You can keep using it so long as you do not try to use another Apple ID with it since to do that you would have to sign out of your current Apple ID (which is locked) and you won't be able to do that. On the other hand, Activation Lock renders the entire device unusable till the lock is cleared.

![apple id locked message](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/10/unlock-apple-id-on-iphone-13-3.jpg)

In short, Apple ID Lock is about a user's account with Apple, akin to how Google Account works on Android devices. Apple ID Lock locks a user's account with Apple while retaining complete usage of the Apple iPhone 12 Pro device whereas Activation Lock locks the Apple iPhone 12 Pro device and prevents anyone from using it until the correct credentials are entered. This is about verifying the ownership of the Apple iPhone 12 Pro device and works to deter theft of Apple devices.

## Part II: Checking If Your Apple ID Is Locked

![the message of apple id locked](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/10/unlock-apple-id-on-iphone-13-4.jpg)

A locked Apple ID is rather unmistakable. Your device would keep telling you that your Apple ID is locked for your security. Your Apple ID could be locked or disabled altogether if someone has tried to gain access to your account (and, obviously, failed). Apple would disable access to the Apple ID unless you are able to prove rightful ownership and reset the password successfully.

## Part III: Reasons for Locked Apple ID

There can be a few reasons why your Apple ID is locked. You forgot the password and now it is locked since you entered the wrong password too many times. A scarier prospect, albeit a real one, is that some malicious actor attempted to login into your Apple ID account but failed. Had they succeeded, you would have gotten a message that 'your Apple ID is being used on another device' now.

Apple does a lot to ensure that your Apple ID remains safe. You trust Apple with a lot of your data, including financial data by way of your credit cards associated with Apple ID to make purchases on the App Store and iTunes Store. Therefore, some of the time, Apple preempts issues by proactively locking up your Apple ID or even disabling it. It goes without saying that sometimes it is something so simple as a software error that is believed to have locked up Apple IDs for many users around the world a while ago. It is also entirely possible that it was some malicious actor probing the servers for accounts.

All of these will result in a locked Apple ID that users will have to reset their password to in order to gain access back.

## Part IV: How to Unlock Apple ID on Apple iPhone 12 Pro

![apple id webpage](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/10/unlock-apple-id-on-iphone-13-1.jpg)

It is unfortunate you are facing a locked Apple ID. Apple tries its best to make users aware of safety protocols they need to follow to minimize and mitigate such unfortunate occurrences, such as using two-factor authentication, trusted devices, trusted phone numbers, passwords, passcodes, etc. that serve as deterrents to prevent unauthorized access to devices and accounts. Yet, when the unfortunate happens, what to do?

### IV.I: Unlock Apple ID Via Two-Factor Authentication

Apple implemented two-factor authentication a long time ago to prevent unauthorized access to Apple ID accounts. If you have it enabled, you would be able to use two-factor authentication to unlock your Apple ID again.

Step 1: Go to **<https://iforgot.apple.com>**.

![apple id iforgot support page](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/10/unlock-apple-id-on-iphone-13-5.jpg)

Step 2: Key in your Apple ID and proceed.

Step 3: Confirm your mobile number associated with the Apple ID.

![apple id iforgot support ](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/10/unlock-apple-id-on-iphone-13-6.jpg)

If you have another device associated with the Apple ID and it is a trusted device, you can now receive instructions to proceed with a two-factor code on that device.

![using iforgot support page to unlock](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/10/unlock-apple-id-on-iphone-13-7.jpg)

## Part 5: Forgot Apple ID? How to Reset Apple ID

Like your password, Apple can help you recover your Apple ID or username as well. Just follow this concise guide:

1. Open any web browser and go to the following URL: [iforgot.apple.com](http://iforgot.apple.com/).
2. Click the "Forgot Apple ID" option.
3. You will be prompted to enter your First Name, Last Name and your Email Address.
4. You also have the option of entering up to 3 email addresses that you have used in the past.
5. Click the "Next" button after which you will be presented with two other options. Click "Reset By Email" to receive the account reset instructions on your recovery email. Alternatively, click on "Answer Security Questions" to recover your Apple account right there on the website.

## Part 6: Using Apple's Two-step Verification (Forgot Apple Password)

Two-step authentication is an old Apple security feature and it still happens to be up and running. If you had set it up for your account, you can use it if you forgot Apple ID password. Here's how it works:

1. Go to the URL [iforgot.apple.com](http://iforgot.apple.com/).
2. Click the "Enter your Apple ID" option and type in your Apple ID to launch the recovery process.
3. You should be prompted to enter your recovery key. Type it in and click "Continue".

![check forgot apple id](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/elcapitan-apple-id-two-step-recovery-key.jpg)

1. You should then choose a trusted recovery device that is currently available to you and click "Next".
2. Apple should send a verification code to the Apple iPhone 12 Pro device you selected. Enter this code as requested on the website and click "Next".
3. After the verification is complete, you can now set up a new password and hopefully, you'll remember it this time.

**Note:** Be wary of using recovery keys! Though they are a very secure and effective method of password recovery, you could easily get permanently locked out of your Apple account. When using a recovery key, you initially need:

1. An Apple ID password.
2. A trusted device that you can easily access.
3. The actual Recovery Key.

Now if you happen to lose any two of the above at the same time, there is no way of recovering your account and you simply have to create a new one.

## Part 7: Using Apple's Two-Factor Authentication (Forgot Apple ID Password)

This is a new account recovery option that is built into iOS 9 and OS X El Capitan. If you have enabled it for your account, you can change or reset Apple password from [iforgot.apple.com](http://iforgot.apple.com/) or from any trusted iPad, iPhone, or iPod touch if you forgot your Apple ID password. The trusted device, however, only works if it has a passcode enabled.

### How to reset Apple password on Your own iPhone

1. Open [iforgot.apple.com](http://iforgot.apple.com/) on any web browser and enter your Apple ID.
2. You can now choose to "Reset from another device," or you can "Use trusted phone number." Choose either option, then click "Continue."

![check forgot apple id](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/appleid-password-recovery-two-factor-screens-01.jpg)

1. It would help if you now waited for prompt requesting access to the trusted device or phone number. Click "Allow." You can now reset your password.

### Recover/reset Apple password on a trusted Apple iOS device

1. On the Apple iPhone 12 Pro device, open Settings > iCloud.
2. Select your name, then select "Password & Security."
3. Select "Change Password" and enter your new password. Voila! You're now reunited with your account.

If you can't access the trusted device, you can recover your password on any other iOS device:

### Recover/reset Apple password on any other iOS device

1. Open Settings > iCloud.
2. Select Forgot Apple ID and Password.
3. Follow the given steps to recover your account.

Now, if none of these methods work and you're completely locked out and completely frustrated, then you should [contact Apple](http://support.apple.com/en-us/HT5699) and seek their help to regain access to your account.

## Part 8: Recover lost data (Forgot Apple ID or Apple Password)

If you can't log into your Apple account even after all this hassle, and if you're permanently locked out of your iCloud and Apple accounts, then you can try to [recover iCloud password](https://drfone.wondershare.com/icloud/how-to-recover-icloud-password.html), but your biggest concern should be to save and recover as much data as possible.
