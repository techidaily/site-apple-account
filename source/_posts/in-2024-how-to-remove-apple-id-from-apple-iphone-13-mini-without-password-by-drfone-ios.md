- **Step 4: Apple ID Removal will Begin**

Dr.Fone will immediately begin removing the Apple ID from the Apple iPhone 13 mini device. You should see a progress bar indicating how long the process will take. Ordinarily, the removal should take just a few seconds. When the process is complete, you will see a notification on the screen letting you know that the Apple ID has been removed.
