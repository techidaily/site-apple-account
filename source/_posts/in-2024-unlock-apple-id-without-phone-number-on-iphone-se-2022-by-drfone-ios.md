Apple ID accepts phone numbers for linking for two-factor authentication. The local number in the region is needed for pairing the number and Apple ID.

3. **Does Changing Apple ID affect Phone Number?**

No, the Apple ID and phone number are not connected as features or codes. So, adjusting the Apple ID will not affect your device's phone number.

### Conclusion

Indeed, there are multiple methods you can take to remove the phone number registered to your Apple ID successfully. They are accessible in multiple ways through Mac, iPad, or iPhone settings. If you forgot the Apple ID, you could even remove it using [Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/iphone-unlock/). Ultimately, choose the process to trust based on your specific needs.
