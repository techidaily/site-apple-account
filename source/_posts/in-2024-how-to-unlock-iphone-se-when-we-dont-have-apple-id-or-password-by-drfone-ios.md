**Step 1:** Firstly, you need to reboot your device into Recovery Mode. Then, launch iTunes and plug it in the computer. Now, iTunes will detect your device in recovery mode. Hit on Restore iPhone and wait for the process to complete.

**Step 2:** Your device will restart to the “Hello” screen upon completion. From the menu, choose language and country.

**Step 3:** Tap on “Proceed” to get into the Wi-Fi settings page.

**Step 4:** Now click on the “i” icon bonded by a circle next to Wi-Fi.

**Note:** In case, you are already connected to a Wi-Fi network, ensure to click on it first and then tap on “Forget This Network” to have the “i” icon visible.

**Step 5:** Now, when you tap on the “i” icon next to any Wi-Fi network (not connected), you need to look for the “Configure DNS” server option. Click on it and then select “Manual”, then click “Add Server.”

You have to select the DNS from the option available according to your region.

- USA/North America: 104.154.51.7
- Europe: 104.155.28.90
- Asia: 104.155.220.58
- Other areas: 78.109.17.60

**Step 6:** Now, save the settings, return to the connection page and connect to your Wi-Fi.

**Step 7:** You need to wait for your device to get connected with the iCloud DNS bypass server automatically.
