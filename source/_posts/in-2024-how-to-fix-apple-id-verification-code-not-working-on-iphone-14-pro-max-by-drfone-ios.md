## Part 1: When Does the Apple Verification ID Failed Prompt Appear?

Before diving into solutions, it’s essential to understand the various scenarios that can trigger the “**Apple Verification ID Failed**” prompt. Recognizing the cause of the problem is the first step toward the right fix. Let’s explore the common reasons you might encounter this issue:

### Wrong Password Input

One of the most straightforward reasons for a failed verification is entering the wrong password. This could be a simple typing error or misremembering your password. Repeated wrong attempts can also lead to your account being temporarily disabled as a security measure.

### Apple Server Issues

At times, the problem may not be on your end. Apple’s servers can experience downtime or technical glitches like any other online service. During such instances, verification processes might fail, as the server cannot authenticate your credentials.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->




### Slow Internet or Intermittent Connection

A stable and reliable internet connection is improtant for the verification process. If your internet is slow or experiencing intermittent connectivity, it can disrupt the communication between your device and Apple’s servers, leading to verification failure.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->




### Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) Issues

Apple’s two-factor authentication provides an extra layer of security. However, it can also be a source of problems. If there’s a delay in receiving the 2FA code or if [<u>2FA fails to work</u>](https://drfone.wondershare.com/android-issue/authentication-error.html), you won’t be able to complete the verification process. This could be due to network issues or, sometimes, glitches within the 2FA system itself.

### Suspicious Activity

Apple takes your security seriously. If there’s any unusual activity detected on your account, such as login attempts from unfamiliar locations or devices, Apple might lock your account as a precaution. This can trigger the verification failed prompt as the system seeks to protect your account from potential unauthorized access.

By understanding these scenarios, you can diagnose better why you’re facing the issue of **Apple verification ID not working**. In the following sections, we will explore solutions tailored to these specific problems, helping you regain access to your account efficiently.

## Part 2: How To Fix Apple ID Verification Failed

### Method 1: Connecting to a Stabler Internet Connection

A stable internet connection is crucial. If you’re encountering issues, switch to a more reliable Wi-Fi network. Alternatively, toggling your Wi-Fi or mobile data off and back on can refresh your connection.

### Method 2: Changing Password/2FA Device Using Apple ID Account

If you’re facing troubles due to password errors or 2FA issues, resetting your password or updating 2FA settings may help. Visit **Settings** > **Apple ID account page** > **Sign In & Security** and follow the instructions to **Change Password** or update your **Two-Factor Authentication** settings.

![change password 2-factor authentication](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/apple-id-verification-not-working-03.jpg)

### Method 3: Check iPhone’s Date & Time Settings

Sometimes, simply signing out and back into your Apple ID can resolve verification issues. Navigate to **Settings**, tap your name at the top, scroll down, and select **Sign Out**. After signing out, sign back in and check if the issue persists.

### Method 5: Disabling VPN

If you’re using a VPN, it can sometimes cause issues with Apple ID verification. Try disabling your VPN from the **Settings** or the VPN app you’re using, and then attempt the verification process again.

### Method 6: Updating to the Latest iOS

Running an outdated iOS version can cause compatibility issues. Go to **Settings**, select **General**, and tap on **Software Update**. If an update is available, download and install it to ensure your device is up-to-date.

### Method 7: Checking Apple Server Status and Trying Again Later

Sometimes, the problem is on Apple’s end. Check the Apple System Status page to see if there are any issues with their servers. If there are, it’s best to wait and try the verification process later.

By following these methods, you should be able to resolve the “Apple ID Verification Failed” issue and regain full access to your Apple ID functionalities.

## Part 6: Using Apple's Two-step Verification (Forgot Apple Password)

Two-step authentication is an old Apple security feature and it still happens to be up and running. If you had set it up for your account, you can use it if you forgot Apple ID password. Here's how it works:

1. Go to the URL [iforgot.apple.com](http://iforgot.apple.com/).
2. Click the "Enter your Apple ID" option and type in your Apple ID to launch the recovery process.
3. You should be prompted to enter your recovery key. Type it in and click "Continue".

![check forgot apple id](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/elcapitan-apple-id-two-step-recovery-key.jpg)

1. You should then choose a trusted recovery device that is currently available to you and click "Next".
2. Apple should send a verification code to the Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max device you selected. Enter this code as requested on the website and click "Next".
3. After the verification is complete, you can now set up a new password and hopefully, you'll remember it this time.

**Note:** Be wary of using recovery keys! Though they are a very secure and effective method of password recovery, you could easily get permanently locked out of your Apple account. When using a recovery key, you initially need:

1. An Apple ID password.
2. A trusted device that you can easily access.
3. The actual Recovery Key.

Now if you happen to lose any two of the above at the same time, there is no way of recovering your account and you simply have to create a new one.

## Part 7: Using Apple's Two-Factor Authentication (Forgot Apple ID Password)

This is a new account recovery option that is built into iOS 9 and OS X El Capitan. If you have enabled it for your account, you can change or reset Apple password from [iforgot.apple.com](http://iforgot.apple.com/) or from any trusted iPad, iPhone, or iPod touch if you forgot your Apple ID password. The trusted device, however, only works if it has a passcode enabled.

### How to reset Apple password on Your own iPhone

1. Open [iforgot.apple.com](http://iforgot.apple.com/) on any web browser and enter your Apple ID.
2. You can now choose to "Reset from another device," or you can "Use trusted phone number." Choose either option, then click "Continue."

## Part 8: Recover lost data (Forgot Apple ID or Apple Password)

If you can't log into your Apple account even after all this hassle, and if you're permanently locked out of your iCloud and Apple accounts, then you can try to [recover iCloud password](https://drfone.wondershare.com/icloud/how-to-recover-icloud-password.html), but your biggest concern should be to save and recover as much data as possible.

Because the iCloud and Apple passwords are the same, you would also lose all the data that you've kept in your iCloud. However, you can retrieve it all using third-party software called [Dr.Fone - Data Recovery (iOS)](https://drfone.wondershare.com/data-recovery-iphone.html).
