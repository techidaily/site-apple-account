## Apple ID Locked or Disabled On Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max? 7 Mehtods You Can't-Miss

Apple ID refers to the authentication method available for the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device to compromise users' personal information and settings. The Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max Apple ID will allow you to store and control data available on the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device; however, you need to re-generate the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max passcode if you have forgotten the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max passcode. Suppose, if you have forgotten the passcode and entered the wrong passcode six times, your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max gets locked or has been disabled. According to your settings, if you have entered the wrong passcode too much time could even make your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max delete all the data available.

This article will discuss how you can **unlock Apple ID** and remain secure. If you receive a message that you have entered the wrong passcode or forgotten your passcode, you have to follow some steps to regain access to your Apple Id.

## Why Is Your Apple ID Locked or Disabled?

![apple id locked](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/03/apple-id-locked.png)

Some of the reasons causing your Apple ID locked or disabled are listed below:

- If you have entered the wrong passcode or security question too many times in a row, Apple ID gets locked. (Avoid entering the incorrect password more than 3 times)
- If you haven't used your Apple ID for an extended period, possibly making your Apple ID disabled or locked. When Apple modifies the requirement for passcode and security questions, you have not updated the information.

If you frequently change your Apple ID or passcode on the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device, Apple possibly considers that your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max faces a security threat and might lock your Apple ID.

## Part 3: Sign Out of Apple ID Without Password by Resetting Your Apple ID Password

If you find yourself unable to recall your Apple ID password, you can reset it through a simple process. Here's how to sign out of your Apple ID without a password by resetting your Apple ID password:

![tap on change password option](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/11/sign-out-apple-id-6.jpg)

**Step 2:** Simply follow the on-screen instructions to complete the password reset process. You can also perform these steps on a trusted iPad or Apple Watch.

## Part 4: Sign Out of Apple ID without Password on Apple Web

Another convenient way how to sign out of Apple ID without the password is to reset the password of your Apple ID by tapping the “**Forgot Password**” option. In this case, however, you must remember all the security questions to reset your password successfully. If you don’t remember the security questions, you can also reset the recovery password using the registered e-mail ID.

Follow these instructions to reset your password and then sign out of the Apple ID.

**Step 1:** Go to the [Apple ID Account Page](https://appleid.apple.com/) and click “**Forgot Apple ID or Password**”.

**Step 2:** Enter your Apple ID and click “**Continue**”. In the next window, select “**I Need to Reset My Password**”.

**Step 3:** Now, select the method using which you want to reset the password. Here are the three possible options.

- If you’ve set up security questions while creating your Apple ID, you can choose “**Answer Security Questions**”. This method will only work if you remember all the answers to every security question. Once you select this method, you’ll be prompted to a new window, with all security questions. Answer these questions and follow the further instructions to reset your password.
- If you’ve added a recovery e-mail while creating your Apple ID, you can also use it to reset the password. In this case, select “**Get an E-mail**”. You’ll receive a password reset e-mail on your registered email.

- Whichever recovery method you choose, make sure to follow the on-screen instructions carefully. Once your password reset process completes, you’ll have to individually update the password in every iCloud service, be it iTunes or iMessage.

In case you have enabled two-way verification on your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max, you’ll receive a different screen after clicking “Forgot Apple ID or Password”. In this case, you’ll have to follow a different approach to reset your Apple ID password.

**Step 1:** Go to the Apple ID Account page and click “**Forgot ID or Password**”.

**Step 2:** Enter your Apple ID and select the “**Reset Password**” option.

**Step 3:** In the next window, you’ll be asked to enter the “**Recovery Key**”. This is a unique key that is provided when a user enables two-way verification for their iCloud account. Enter the recovery key and click “**Continue**”.

![enter recovery key](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2020/05/enter-recovery-key.jpg)

**Step 4:** Choose a trusted device to receive the verification code. Now, enter this verification code and click “**Continue**”.

**Step 5:** In the next window, enter a new password and tap “**Reset Password**”.

Once you’ve reset the password, you can easily sign out of the Apple ID by navigating through Settings>Apple ID>Sign Out on your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max.

## Part 5: Sign Out of Apple ID without Password by Apple Support App

If you're unable to reset your Apple ID password on your own, you can seek assistance from Apple's official Support app. It provides expert guidance and troubleshooting. Here's how to use the Apple Support app to sign out of your Apple ID without a password:

**Step 1:** Access the Apple Support app on another Apple device. In case it's not available, you have the option to download the Apple Support app from the App Store. Scroll to the bottom until you find Support Tools, then select “Reset Password.” Here, opt for "A different Apple ID."
