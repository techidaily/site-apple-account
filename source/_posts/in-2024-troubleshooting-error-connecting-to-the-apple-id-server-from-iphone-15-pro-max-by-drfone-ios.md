**Step 4:** Upon successful verification, you will be asked to create a new password. Please make a new password now and then make sure to remember it.

That's it you can now make use of this new password to unlock your Apple ID.

![configure dns server](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/03/dns-bypass-2.png)

- Europe: 104.155.28.90
- Asia: 104.155.220.58
- Other areas: 78.109.17.60

![iclouddnsbypass home](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/03/dns-bypass-3.png)
