## Part 1: Deleting iCloud Account? Essential Preparations Before You Proceed

Before you learn the steps on "**how to delete icloud account**," take steps to ensure a smooth transition and prevent the loss of valuable data. Before you permanently remove an iCloud account, ensure you've completed the following:

Backup Your Data

Create a local copy of your files, photos, videos, and documents on your computer or an external hard drive. You can [<u>use cloud storage services </u>](https://drfone.wondershare.com/backup-iphone/fix-not-enough-space-on-iphone-to-restore-backup.html) or third-party apps like [<u>Wondershare Dr.Fone</u>](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/drfone-toolkit/) to selectively restore it later.

Request a Copy of Your Data

Apple provides a service on selected regions that allows you to request a copy of data associated with your Apple ID before deleting your account. It includes records of your sign-in, account details, iCloud contents, and Apple retail store transactions. Having a copy of this data can be useful if you need to access it in the future.

To request a copy of your data, go to Privacy Apple on your web browser. Under the **Obtain a copy of your data** section, click **Request a copy of your data**. Next, select the data you need and click **Continue**.

![request a copy of your data](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/11/how-to-delete-icloud-account-02.jpg)

Review Your Active Subscriptions

Also, to "**delete iCloud account**," first review any active subscriptions you may have, such as Apple Music, Apple TV+, or iCloud+ storage. If you don't want to continue these subscriptions, cancel them before deleting your account.

Download Backups of Your Apps, Games, Music, Movies, TV Shows, Books, and Audiobooks

Your iCloud account may contain backups of your apps, games, and media purchases. Before deleting your Apple ID account, download them to your device or a computer to ensure you don't lose access to your favorite content.

Pay Loan Installments You Have With Apple Pay Later

If you have an outstanding loan with Apple Pay Later, pay off any remaining installments before you delete your iCloud account. Otherwise, you may incur late fees or other penalties.

![pay apple store purchase](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/11/how-to-delete-icloud-account-04.jpg)

- Restricted device access
- App malfunctioning
- Constant Sign-in errors

## Part 5: How To Remove an iCloud Account Without Deleting an Apple ID Account?

Deciding to permanently "**delete iCloud account**" or Apple ID is a significant step. If you're unsure about this irreversible action, consider deactivating your account. Deactivating your Apple ID temporarily suspends it. However, this feature may depend on your location.

Once you deactivate your Apple ID, you can no longer use it to sign into any Apple services, including iCloud, the App Store, iTunes, Apple Books, FaceTime, and Apple Pay. Even so, deactivating your Apple ID does not delete your account. You can reactivate your account anytime to regain access to all your Apple services and data.

Here's how to temporarily deactivate your Apple ID account:

- **Step 1:** Go to Apple's Data and Privacy website. Sign in using your Apple ID.
- **Step 2:** Scroll down to the **Temporarily deactivate your account** section and click **Request to deactivate your account**.
