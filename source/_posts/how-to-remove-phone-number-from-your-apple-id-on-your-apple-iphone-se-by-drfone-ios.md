Typically, it is impossible to use a PC or Mac to access and **remove AirTag from Apple ID**. One has to use the Apple iPhone SE or iPad device only. But what if the smartphone screen or Apple ID is locked?

You need to unlock the Apple iPhone SE device using capable software like [Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/iphone-unlock/) to remove the blockage. This software can remove many different Apple screen lock types, like Black Screen of Death, Face ID Lock, Screen Time Passcode, and more.

**Top Features:**

1. Users get at least ten retries for the password or lock removal attempt.
2. Suitable for removing various screen locks, Apple ID locks, etc.
3. Works to bypass Apple ID account locking without a password within seconds.
4. It allows Apple ID lock removal even with the active Find My iPhone feature on the smartphone.
