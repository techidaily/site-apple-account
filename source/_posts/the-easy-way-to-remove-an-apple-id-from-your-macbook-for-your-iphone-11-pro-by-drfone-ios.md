## Part 5: How To Remove an iCloud Account Without Deleting an Apple ID Account?

Deciding to permanently "**delete iCloud account**" or Apple ID is a significant step. If you're unsure about this irreversible action, consider deactivating your account. Deactivating your Apple ID temporarily suspends it. However, this feature may depend on your location.

Once you deactivate your Apple ID, you can no longer use it to sign into any Apple services, including iCloud, the App Store, iTunes, Apple Books, FaceTime, and Apple Pay. Even so, deactivating your Apple ID does not delete your account. You can reactivate your account anytime to regain access to all your Apple services and data.

Here's how to temporarily deactivate your Apple ID account:

- **Step 1:** Go to Apple's Data and Privacy website. Sign in using your Apple ID.
- **Step 2:** Scroll down to the **Temporarily deactivate your account** section and click **Request to deactivate your account**.

![request to deactivate your account](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/11/how-to-delete-icloud-account-26.jpg)

- **Step 3:** Select a reason for deactivating your account from the drop-down menu, then click **Continue**.
- **Step 4:** Review the information and follow the on-screen instructions to complete deactivation.

**Note:**

Keep the unique alphanumeric access code you'll receive. You'll need it to reactivate your Apple ID account.
