The added AirTag stays connected with one Apple ID account until you reset it. So, use the process mentioned to remove the AirTag via iPhone or iPad. If the iPad or iPhone you are using has locked the Apple ID, you can use another software [Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/iphone-unlock/), to access it without data loss securely. Then, follow the steps mentioned to reset the AirTag here.
