## Apple ID Locked or Disabled On Apple iPhone 12 mini? 7 Mehtods You Can't-Miss

The Apple iPhone 12 mini Apple ID will allow you to store and control data available on the Apple iPhone 12 mini device; however, you need to re-generate the Apple iPhone 12 mini passcode if you have forgotten the Apple iPhone 12 mini passcode. Suppose, if you have forgotten the passcode and entered the wrong passcode six times, your Apple iPhone 12 mini gets locked or has been disabled. According to your settings, if you have entered the wrong passcode too much time could even make your Apple iPhone 12 mini delete all the data available.

![apple id locked](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/03/apple-id-locked.png)

Some of the reasons causing your Apple ID locked or disabled are listed below:

- If you have entered the wrong passcode or security question too many times in a row, Apple ID gets locked. (Avoid entering the incorrect password more than 3 times)
- If you haven't used your Apple ID for an extended period, possibly making your Apple ID disabled or locked. When Apple modifies the requirement for passcode and security questions, you have not updated the information.

If you frequently change your Apple ID or passcode on the Apple iPhone 12 mini device, Apple possibly considers that your Apple iPhone 12 mini faces a security threat and might lock your Apple ID.
