## Why Apple Account Disabled On your Apple iPhone 14 Pro? How to Fix

Apple is one of the leading smartphone developing enterprises that has introduced the world to a contemporary set of features that are not common among other leading smartphone companies. One of the major distinguishing characteristics of Apple has been displayed in its present security protocols. Apple Account is regarded as one of the most significant credentials of the Apple iPhone 14 Pro and iPad that is responsible for connecting and holding the applications and the assorted data. Many users have generally reported unusual situations that got their Apple Account disabled. There are several reasons that can be associated with the Apple account getting disabled. The major repercussion that is associated with it is unnecessary data loss following the suspension of all products that have been bought with the account over time. This article provides you an impressive overview of the major reasons that lead to your Apple Account getting disabled, followed by the associated mechanisms that can be tested to secure the account.

## Part 1. Why is the Apple account disabled?

Apple iPhone, iPad, and other devices operate over a single Operating System, with its own protocols and unique mechanisms that distinguish it from other smartphone models in the market. Apple believes in securing the data and identification of its users with its state-of-the-art security measures. Under such circumstances, it usually gets possible for the user to have his Apple account disabled unnecessarily. Whenever you encounter such a situation, there are several messages that might be displayed on your device to prompt you over the disabling of the account. These messages usually appear in situations where you intend to sign in to some platform with your associated Apple ID. The most common messages that appear on the screen are:

- "This Apple ID has been disabled for security reasons."
- “You can’t sign in because your account was disabled for security reasons.”
- "This Apple ID has been locked for security reasons."

The messages that have been stated above are usually depicting a security anomaly that led to the disabling of the associated Apple ID. However, there can be several reasons that would have led to such circumstances, which are described as follows.

- There might be incorrect forced logging in into your Apple ID for multiple tries.
- Any user would have entered incorrect security questions multiple times.
- The other information associated with the Apple ID would have been entered incorrectly numerous times.

## Part 2. Is “Your account has been disabled in the App Store and iTunes” the same as “This Apple ID has been disabled for security reasons”?

There are several instances where you encounter such prompt messages where you are restricted in using the App Store and iTunes. These messages can come in the form of "Your account has been disabled in the App Store and iTunes." Over observing this prompt message, it has been discovered that the assorted message is not related to the other common message of "This Apple ID has been disabled for security reasons." The dynamics of getting restricted from using the App Store and iTunes are related to remaining balances that have stuck around for a while over your Apple account. Normally, you may have some billing issues that are prevailing over an unpaid iTunes or App Store order. This problem can be countered through simplistic methods under such conditions where you are having access to the account information and can check for the basic billing information or update the payment method following other settings that are associated with paying bills. Over failure in accessing your account, you are required to contact Apple Support and look for the billing and payment statements to clear up all the remaining dues. Apple has considered covering all the security protocols to perfection, where you have any prevailing Apple charges on your connected credit card that would lead to direct disabling of your Apple Account.

Even though Apple accounts can be generally disabled overpayment issues, there are several security reasons that might restrict you in discovering and buying different products across the App Store and iTunes. It is necessary for you, as an Apple user, to remain prompt of all the issues that are relating to your Apple Account.

## Part 1: When Does the Apple Verification ID Failed Prompt Appear?

Before diving into solutions, it’s essential to understand the various scenarios that can trigger the “**Apple Verification ID Failed**” prompt. Recognizing the cause of the problem is the first step toward the right fix. Let’s explore the common reasons you might encounter this issue:

### Wrong Password Input

One of the most straightforward reasons for a failed verification is entering the wrong password. This could be a simple typing error or misremembering your password. Repeated wrong attempts can also lead to your account being temporarily disabled as a security measure.

### Apple Server Issues

At times, the problem may not be on your end. Apple’s servers can experience downtime or technical glitches like any other online service. During such instances, verification processes might fail, as the server cannot authenticate your credentials.

![apple server status page](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/apple-id-verification-not-working-02.jpg)

### Slow Internet or Intermittent Connection

A stable and reliable internet connection is improtant for the verification process. If your internet is slow or experiencing intermittent connectivity, it can disrupt the communication between your device and Apple’s servers, leading to verification failure.

### Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) Issues

Apple’s two-factor authentication provides an extra layer of security. However, it can also be a source of problems. If there’s a delay in receiving the 2FA code or if [<u>2FA fails to work</u>](https://drfone.wondershare.com/android-issue/authentication-error.html), you won’t be able to complete the verification process. This could be due to network issues or, sometimes, glitches within the 2FA system itself.

### Suspicious Activity

Apple takes your security seriously. If there’s any unusual activity detected on your account, such as login attempts from unfamiliar locations or devices, Apple might lock your account as a precaution. This can trigger the verification failed prompt as the system seeks to protect your account from potential unauthorized access.

By understanding these scenarios, you can diagnose better why you’re facing the issue of **Apple verification ID not working**. In the following sections, we will explore solutions tailored to these specific problems, helping you regain access to your account efficiently.

## Part 2: How To Fix Apple ID Verification Failed

![date & time settings ios](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/apple-id-verification-not-working-04.jpg)

### Method 4: Signing Out/In Your Apple ID

### Method 5: Disabling VPN

If you’re using a VPN, it can sometimes cause issues with Apple ID verification. Try disabling your VPN from the **Settings** or the VPN app you’re using, and then attempt the verification process again.

### Method 6: Updating to the Latest iOS

Running an outdated iOS version can cause compatibility issues. Go to **Settings**, select **General**, and tap on **Software Update**. If an update is available, download and install it to ensure your device is up-to-date.

### Method 7: Checking Apple Server Status and Trying Again Later
