## Part 6: Using Apple's Two-step Verification (Forgot Apple Password)

2. Click the "Enter your Apple ID" option and type in your Apple ID to launch the recovery process.

**Note:** Be wary of using recovery keys! Though they are a very secure and effective method of password recovery, you could easily get permanently locked out of your Apple account. When using a recovery key, you initially need:

1. An Apple ID password.
2. A trusted device that you can easily access.
3. The actual Recovery Key.

The trusted device, however, only works if it has a passcode enabled.

### How to reset Apple password on Your own iPhone

![error connecting to apple id server](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/11/error-connecting-to-apple-id-02.jpg)

### Temporary Problems With Apple Servers

Periodic disruptions in Apple servers can lead to the "**Apple ID verification failed**" issue. These may occur due to routine maintenance or unexpected server outages.

### The Internet Connection Is Not Working

The problem may also stem from a disrupted internet connection. You should investigate your Wi-Fi or cellular data to ensure a stable connection. Restarting routers or switching to an alternative network can also help.

### Problems With Apple ID

Authentication issues can arise if users input incorrect Apple ID credentials or if their accounts face security concerns. Verifying and correcting these details or resetting the Apple ID password is crucial.

### Incorrect Date and Time Settings

The device's date and time settings must be accurate to establish a secure connection with the Apple ID server. You should check and adjust these settings, enabling automatic updates for synchronization.

Ensure a stable connection and troubleshoot any disruptions, considering a switch to an alternative network. You can [<u>follow this guide </u>](https://drfone.wondershare.com/device-diagnostics/check-mobile-signal-stength.html) to check your network signal.
