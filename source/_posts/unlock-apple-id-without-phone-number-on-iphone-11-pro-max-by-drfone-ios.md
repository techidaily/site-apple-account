How To Unlink Apple Watch From Apple ID Without Your Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max?

You can erase your Apple Watch without the paired iPhone, but the Activation Lock will still be active. But, if you give away your Apple Watch without turning off the Activation Lock, the person you give it to cannot use it. They'll have to enter your Apple ID and password to turn off the Activation Lock and use it with a new iPhone.

- **Step 1:** Open the **Settings** app on your Apple Watch.
- **Step 2:** Go to **General** > **Reset**, tap **Erase All Content and Settings**. Then, enter your password, if needed.
