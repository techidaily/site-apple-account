## Verify and repair game files

 Game crashing issues are often triggered by corrupted game files. You can verify and repair game files using Steam. Here’s how to do it:

1. Launch **Steam** and go to your **Library** .
2. **Right-click** on **ELEX II** and select **Properties** .  
![Steam game properties](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Steam-game-F1-2020-properties.jpg)
3. Click **LOCAL FILES** on the left, then click **Verify integrity of game files…** . If Steam finds anything wrong with the game files, it will re-download them from its official server.  
![verify the integrity of game files](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/F1-2020-verify-the-integrity-of-game-files.jpg)

 Depending on the size of the game files, it may take some time to verify all your game files.

 Launch ELEX II after the verifying process is complete. See if it crashes again. If this issue persists, try the next fix, below.

## Update your graphics driver

 Graphics driver is essential to the functioning of video games. If ELEX II keeps crashing on your PC, it’s likely that you have the corrupted or outdated graphics driver on your PC. So you should update your drivers to see if it fixes the game crashing issues.

 You can update manually: first go to the manufacturer’s download page ([AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support) /[NVIDIA](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) ), then search your model and download the correct driver installer. But if you don’t have the time, patience or skills to update the driver manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to be troubled by the wrong driver you would be downloading, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing. **Driver Easy handles it all.**

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the **[FREE](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  or the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  of Driver Easy.

## Install the latest ELEX II patch

 The developer of ELEX II releases regular game patches to fix bugs and improve gaming performance.

 It’s possible that a recent patch has caused the game crash issue, and that a new patch is required to fix it. If a patch is available, it will be detected by Steam, and the latest game patch will be automatically downloaded and installed when you launch the game.

 Run**ELEX II** again and check if the game crashes get fixed. If it didn’t work, or there was no new game patch available, move on to next fix, below.

## Disable overlays

 Overlays sometimes the overlay would interfere with the game and even block the game files. If you’re using the Steam Overlay while playing the game, try disabling Steam Overlay for ELEX II and see if the game crashes again:

1. Launch Steam and navigate to **the LIBRARY tab** . **right-click** on _ELEX II_ . Then select **Properties** .  
![Steam game properties](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Steam-game-F1-2020-properties.jpg)
2. Uncheck **Enable Steam Overlay while in-game** .  
![disable steam overlay](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/disable-steam-overlay.jpg)

 If you’re using other apps with overlay features (e.g. Xbox Game Bar, Discord, Nvidia GeForce Experience, Twitch, etc.), make sure you’ve disabled the in-game overlay in those apps feature.

 Run ELEX II and check if the it crashes again. If the game still crashes, try the next fix, below.

## Temporarily disable anti-virus software

 3rd party antivirus software sometimes may block game files, which would also crash the game.

 You can try adding both the game folder and Steam as an exception to your third-party antivirus application. If necessary, temporarily disable the 3rd party antivirus software before playing the game.

 Launch ELEX II and see if the game crashes after you disabled the anti-virus software on your PC.

If this fix didn’t work, try the next fix, below.

## Repair corrupted system files

 Windows system file corruption will also lead the game to crash. If you’ve played PC games for years, you may have already known that even a missing or corrupted .dll file (dynamic link libraries) would cause a game to crash.
