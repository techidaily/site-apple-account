## Part 4: Erase an iPhone Without Apple ID via Activation Lock Support Request

The proof should show the serial number of the iPhone, [<u>IMEI</u>](https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/unlock-phone-free-with-imei-number.html), or MEID. Once Apple unlocks the Activation Lock on your Apple iPhone 13, your Apple iPhone 13 contents will be permanently erased.

To start this request, follow these steps:

- **Step 1:** Head to Apple's Activation Lock support page. (al-support.apple.com)
- **Step 2:** Scroll down the page, select the agreement checkbox, click **Continue**, and it will redirect you to a new page.
