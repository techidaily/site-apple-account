### 1.3 Create a new password

If you have enabled two-way verification on your Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max, you can also delete the iCloud account by resetting the password. In this case, however, you’ll have to visit the [Apple ID Account Page](https://appleid.apple.com/) and use it to reset the password.

Here’s how to delete iCloud account without password by creating a new password.

**Step 1:** Visit the Apple ID Account page and select “Forgot Apple ID or Password”.
