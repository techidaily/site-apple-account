## Part 1: Why Delete Apple ID and iCloud Account?

There are as many reasons to leave the Apple ecosystem as why you should join it. Apple devices are known for security, but it also means that you have less control over their settings. It is also a closed ecosystem that forces you to limit yourself to a specific set of apps and services. Some of the reasons why people might want to **remove their Apple ID from their MacBook** are the following:

- **Switching Platforms:** If you intend to leave Apple devices and move to another platform like Android, it makes sense to delete the Apple ID. Deleting the ID will make it safer for you to sell your old Apple device to others.
- **Privacy Concerns:** While Apple is comparatively secure, your data is still stored on Apple servers. It means the company can still access your data. It will require deleting your Apple ID if you want to delete all personal data from Apple servers.
- **Changing Account:** Getting a new Apple ID means you need to delete your old Apple ID. It will save you the trouble of managing two different IDs with multiple accounts associated with each one.
- **Shared Apple ID:** It is possible that you were sharing your account with your partner or another family member and now want to get your own account. Removing the old account completely and using a new one can be the safest way.

## Why Is Your Apple ID Locked or Disabled?

![apple id locked](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/03/apple-id-locked.png)

Some of the reasons causing your Apple ID locked or disabled are listed below:

- If you have entered the wrong passcode or security question too many times in a row, Apple ID gets locked. (Avoid entering the incorrect password more than 3 times)
- If you haven't used your Apple ID for an extended period, possibly making your Apple ID disabled or locked. When Apple modifies the requirement for passcode and security questions, you have not updated the information.

If you frequently change your Apple ID or passcode on the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device, Apple possibly considers that your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max faces a security threat and might lock your Apple ID.

## Method 6: A Loophole: DNS Bypass

If you want to unlock **iPhone 13 Apple ID** and don't remember the password**,** you can use this DNS bypass method. But to make use of this method, you need to first factory reset your device and gain access to the “Hello” screen. Here's how you can make use of this method.

**Step 1:** Firstly, you need to reboot your device into Recovery Mode. Then, launch iTunes and plug it in the computer. Now, iTunes will detect your device in recovery mode. Hit on Restore iPhone and wait for the process to complete.

**Step 2:** Your device will restart to the “Hello” screen upon completion. From the menu, choose language and country.

**Step 3:** Tap on “Proceed” to get into the Wi-Fi settings page.

**Step 4:** Now click on the “i” icon bonded by a circle next to Wi-Fi.

![click i icon](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/03/dns-bypass-1.png)

**Note:** In case, you are already connected to a Wi-Fi network, ensure to click on it first and then tap on “Forget This Network” to have the “i” icon visible.

**Step 5:** Now, when you tap on the “i” icon next to any Wi-Fi network (not connected), you need to look for the “Configure DNS” server option. Click on it and then select “Manual”, then click “Add Server.”

![configure dns server](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/03/dns-bypass-2.png)

You have to select the DNS from the option available according to your region.

- USA/North America: 104.154.51.7
- Europe: 104.155.28.90
- Asia: 104.155.220.58
- Other areas: 78.109.17.60

**Step 6:** Now, save the settings, return to the connection page and connect to your Wi-Fi.

**Step 7:** You need to wait for your device to get connected with the iCloud DNS bypass server automatically.

**Step 8:** Once you are connected to the DNS server successfully, you can then use apps and features available on your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max in an alternative way.

**Note:** This method is just a hack to use your device without the need for Apple ID. This method doesn't unlock your Apple ID.

## Method 7: Ask Apple Support
