## Part 2. Remove Apple ID from iPhone without Password with iCloud.com

It is better to possess more than one solution to a single issue, which could come in handy when the first one doesn’t work for you. To remove the Apple ID without the password would require you to use iCloud.

You would use the Find My Devices utility of the service to remove the ID. Here are the steps:

**Step 1.** Visit the iCloud website using your favorite browser. Once you are there, sign in through your Apple ID.

**Step 2.** Select the “Find iPhone” option to initiate removing the Apple ID from the Apple iPhone 12 mini permanently.

**Step 3.** There will be an option in front of you with the title “My Devices” select it.

**Step 4.** You will be presented with four options, select “Remove from Account,” and the Apple ID of the previous owner will no longer plague the iPhone.

That’s it! Once you complete the steps mentioned above, the account will be removed from the iPhone, and you can sign in with your own Apple ID.

## Part 3. Remove Apple ID by Restoring the Apple iPhone 12 mini in iTunes

In the case that neither of the above methods works for you, you can try removing the Apple ID from the Apple iPhone 12 mini without a password through Apple’s popular platform, iTunes. It is better to remember that this method will not work if the Apple iPhone 12 mini has iCloud enabled.

The first step is to get your Apple iPhone 12 mini into recovery mode. The process of entering recovery mode varies depending on which iPhone you have.

So here, we have listed the method for every Apple iPhone 12 mini to provide convenience. Here’s how to enter recovery mode:

**Step 1.** Power off your device by pressing one of the volume buttons and the side button until you see the power off slider. Slide to power off your device.

**Step 2.** Get your USB cable and connect your phone to our computer while holding the side button. Leave the side button when you see the recovery-mode screen.

**Step 3.** Once you have gotten your Apple iPhone 12 mini into recovery mode, you can begin to restore it using iTunes.
