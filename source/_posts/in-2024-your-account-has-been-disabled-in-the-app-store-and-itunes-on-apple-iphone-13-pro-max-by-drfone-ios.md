**Step 2:** Once you authenticate, click on the prompt indicating the option to “Continue.”

**Step 3:** Once you click on the “Get started” prompt on the screen, you will get a tab to “Delete your account.” This will prompt you with an Apple message indicating the information regarding the deletion process time.

**Step 4:** Before everything, make sure you back up your data and follow the instructions steps prompted by Apple’s website. This will lead you to choose a reason for deletion from the click-down option and click “Continue.”

**Message –** You will get the details of the entire process for a quick review before you can submit for the final deletion of the policies

**Step 5:** Click on “Delete terms and conditions” by checking the read and agreed on the box. Make sure to provide a good call-back number to finalize the process.
