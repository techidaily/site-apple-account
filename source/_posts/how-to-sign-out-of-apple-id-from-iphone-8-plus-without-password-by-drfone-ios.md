## Part 3: Other Ways To Change the Apple ID With Ease

Changing your Apple ID on your MacBook through Settings is a straightforward process. There are scenarios where some adjustments may be necessary and some may not. For instance, in the case of purchasing a used MacBook, it's conceivable that the prior owner's Apple ID could still be linked to the Apple iPhone 8 Plus device.

In such instances, you'll need to contact the previous owner and request them to disassociate their Apple ID. Here are two practical methods for **how to change Apple ID on MacBook Air**:

### Way 1: Using the iPhone

The first way the previous owner can remove the Apple ID from your MacBook is by using his iPhone. You can ask the previous owner to follow these steps on their iPhone:

- **Step 1:**Start the process by accessing the Settings app on your Apple iPhone 8 Plus. From there, click on Apple ID on top of the main settings page.

- **Step 1:**Begin by opening the Find My app on the iPhone. There, select the MacBook from the Apple iPhone 8 Plus devices section. On the following screen, scroll to the last option, "Erase This Device."

## Bonus Part: How To Fix Unable To Logout (Change) the Old Apple ID on Mac

Although changing your Apple ID on your Mac is usually a swift procedure, there may be instances where you find it challenging. It's essential to resolve this matter promptly. The reason is that many essential procedures and services are directly linked to your Apple ID. Here are some common reasons why you might face difficulty logging out of the old Apple ID and their solutions:

### 1\. Ongoing iCloud Backup

While the data is backed up on the iCloud from your Mac, you cannot log out from the Apple ID. It is because, while the data is being uploaded, logging out of Apple ID is restricted to ensure that data is not lost during the process.

#### Solution

Wait for the iCloud backup to complete before attempting to log out. You can access the backup information through “iCloud” within your Apple ID settings of System Settings. Here, tap “iCloud Drive” and stop syncing to stop the ongoing iCloud backup process.

### 2\. Bug in macOS

Occasionally, macOS may encounter bugs or glitches that prevent you from logging out of your Apple ID. These issues can usually be resolved with software updates or troubleshooting steps.

#### Solution

To resolve the bugs and glitches within the MacBook, the best option is to update macOS to its latest version. For that, access "System Settings" through Dock and move to the "General" tab. Here, select "[<u>Software Update</u>](https://drfone.wondershare.com/iphone-data-recovery/recover-lost-date-after-ios-17-update.html)" to verify if an update is available and if an update is available, use “Update Now” to update the macOS.

### 3\. Apple Server Inactivity

Sometimes, issues on Apple's servers can disrupt the log-out process. It's recommended to visit Apple's System Status page to ascertain the presence of any ongoing server issues.

#### Solution

You will need to check the official Apple System Status page at [<u>https://www.apple.com/support/systemstatus/</u>](https://www.apple.com/support/systemstatus/). Here, you can find out if the problem behind your inability to log out lies with the Apple servers.
