## Why Is Your Apple ID Locked or Disabled?

![apple id locked](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/03/apple-id-locked.png)

Some of the reasons causing your Apple ID locked or disabled are listed below:

- If you have entered the wrong passcode or security question too many times in a row, Apple ID gets locked. (Avoid entering the incorrect password more than 3 times)
- If you haven't used your Apple ID for an extended period, possibly making your Apple ID disabled or locked. When Apple modifies the requirement for passcode and security questions, you have not updated the information.

If you frequently change your Apple ID or passcode on the Apple iPhone SE (2022) device, Apple possibly considers that your Apple iPhone SE (2022) faces a security threat and might lock your Apple ID.

## Method 1: Professional iPhone Apple ID Lock Removal Tool \[Recommended\]

If you have forgotten your Apple ID password, you are suggested not to enter the wrong passcode in a row. That may lead to data loss. You can download the Dr.Fone– Screen Unlock, which is compatible with different lock screens and will **unlock Apple ID easily**.
