Before you learn the steps on "**how to delete icloud account**," take steps to ensure a smooth transition and prevent the loss of valuable data. Before you permanently remove an iCloud account, ensure you've completed the following:

Backup Your Data

Create a local copy of your files, photos, videos, and documents on your computer or an external hard drive. You can [<u>use cloud storage services </u>](https://drfone.wondershare.com/backup-iphone/fix-not-enough-space-on-iphone-to-restore-backup.html) or third-party apps like [<u>Wondershare Dr.Fone</u>](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/drfone-toolkit/) to selectively restore it later.

Request a Copy of Your Data

Apple provides a service on selected regions that allows you to request a copy of data associated with your Apple ID before deleting your account.
