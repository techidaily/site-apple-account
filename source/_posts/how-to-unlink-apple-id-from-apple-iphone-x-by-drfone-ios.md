![start the process](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/bypass-activation-lock-2.png)

**Step 4.** Begin to remove and wait briefly. The phone will be in a typical state with practically no lock after removing the activation lock.

**Step 5.** The program will remove the activation lock like a flash. Your iPad will begin with no activation lock. You can access and utilize the iPad now. However, you must know that you can't call or use cellular data and iCloud of your new Apple ID after bypassing the lock.

### Method 2. Remove it from iCloud

If you cannot reach the past user but rather you are still in contact with them, they can unlock your iPad. Here are the step-by-step guidelines on eliminating the iPad activation lock through the iCloud web:

- Open the iCloud site in a browser.
- Sign in to the current iCloud account being used with the locked iPhone.
- When you sign in, click on the choice that says Find iPhone.
- Presently, you can remotely perform activities on your phone.
- Click on the drop-down named All Gadgets and pick your iPad.
- Click on Erase iPhone.

### Method 3. Use DNS bypass

Bypassing DNS Server is one more way for you if you're searching for simple methods for eliminating Activation Lock without the past user. Note that this DNS strategy can bypass the iCloud lock for a brief time. Here's how:

**Step 1.** Open your iPad and explore the "Choose a Wi-Fi Network" page.

**Step 2.** Presently, press the Home button and select Wi-Fi settings. Presently, tap the "I" symbol right behind your Wi-Fi network. It will show the properties of the Wi-Fi.

**Step 3.** Select "Configure DNS" and set it as indicated by your region:

![dns bypass](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/remove-activation-lock-without-previous-owner-ipad-2.jpg)

- USA: 104.154.51.7
- South America: 35.199.88.219
- Europe: 104.155.28.90
- Asia: 104.155.220.58
- Australia and Oceania: 35.189.47.23
- Other Continents: 78.100.17.60

**Step 4.** From that point forward, return to the Wi-Fi page.

**Step 5.** Presently, click over and again on “Next” and “Back” and hold on until the iPad connects with your area's iCloud DNS bypass server.

### Method 4. Local Apple Support

Following the techniques above, you can try reaching Apple's local service when you can't remove the Activation Lock. However, you need to provide the following things:

- iPad serial number
- Buying receipt

When they confirm you own the iOS iPad legitimately, they will help you further by unlocking your iPad.
