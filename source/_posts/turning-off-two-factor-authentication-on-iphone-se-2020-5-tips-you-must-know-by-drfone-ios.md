## Turning Off Two Factor Authentication On Apple iPhone SE (2020)? 5 Tips You Must Know

Apple has produced one of the most consumed, acknowledged, and preferred smartphones that allowed them to rule the industry for a considerably long period of time. Their style and presentation were not the only reason that made people look forward to buying an iPhone. Apple created its own operating system and presented their own versions of security and protection. One of the most recognized and impeccable features offered by Apple in its innovative structure was the security and safety through Apple ID and Apple Account. Every important feature that operated throughout the Apple iPhone SE (2020) or iPad was focused over a single entity, the Apple ID. However, apart from the Apple ID, there were several other layers of authentications and verifications that were added throughout the protocol structure. A couple of them are renowned as Two Factor Verification and Two Factor Authentication. This article produces a very generous set of advice that should be looked over while handing these layers of protection. To get a better understanding of the procedures involved, you need to look over the guide to gain better knowledge on how to turn off Two Factor Authentication on your Apple.

![two factor authentication apple](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2020/11/two-factor-authentication-apple.jpg)

## Part 1. Is two-step verification the same as two-factor authentication?

There might be a few differences involved in these two security models; however, it should be kept in mind that they focus their purpose on securing the Apple ID of the user. Two Factor Verification is a security protocol that protects access to the various activities performed through the Apple ID. It attenuates an extra verification step across the Apple iPhone SE (2020) device in addition to the password for the Apple ID. The device receives a verification code from an authentication factor that allows the authorities to confirm the credibility of the user.

The Two Factor Authentication is considered as an upgrade to the Two Factor Verification, which was released two years after the Two Factor Verification, in 2015. This authentication method exempted the offline recovery keys and application-specific passcodes. They added a six-digit authentication code onto the original password and produced an offline, time-dependent code that is to be generated through the Settings of the trusted device of the user. This feature was appended into the iOS 9 and OS X El Capitan with a region-specific target.

## Part 2. How to turn off two-step verification?

As you are aware of the Two-Step Verification process, it is quite easy and typical in configuring. However, when it comes to turning the settings off, it is also a simple and straightforward procedure that can be easily covered by following the steps provided below.

**Step 1:** You are required to open the Apple ID Account web page on your browser and sign in with your Apple ID credentials.

**Step 2:** As you log into the website, access the "Security" section, and tap "Edit" from the options provided on the list.

**Step 3:** Tap on the “Two-Step Verification” option and turn it off. Confirm to conclude the process. You may be required to select the new security questions and verify the data of birth in the process. As you would be done with it, an email would be received across your connected address for confirmation.

## Part 3. How to turn off two-factor authentication? (lower than iOS 10.3)

Two Factor Authentication cannot be turned off in a few cases and accounts for iOS versions greater than 10.3. However, if you have activated Two Factor Authentication across the iOS versions lower than 10.3, you can deactivate the feature through a series of simple steps. The exemption of this security feature across your device leaves it protected only through a password and a few security questions. For turning off the Two Factor Authentication from your Apple device, you need to follow the steps provided as follows:

**Step 1:** Open your browser and access your Apple ID Account website. Provide the details of your Apple ID and log in.

**Step 2:** Tap on “Edit” in the “Security” section and turn off the “Two Factor Authentication” option.

**Step 3:** This would lead you to set new security questions for the Apple ID account, followed by a verification of your date of birth. The successful execution of the process would lead to turning it off.

## Part 4. Why can't you turn off two-factor authentication if you already use it? (iOS 10.3 and later)

For users who have an Apple device with an iOS 10.3 or later version, they cannot turn the Two Factor Authentication off after it is accessed. The latest iOS and macOS included extra layers of security in their features, which led towards a better security foundation and protection of information. Users who have updated their account information can unenroll in two weeks after updating. For this, you are required to simply access the confirmation email that you have received and tap on the link to approach the previous security settings. Thus, it makes it far more than impossible for users to turn their Two Factor Authentication off if they consider it unnecessary for their device. This feature is something that would always remain intact with their device as an extra layer of security. Its absence does leave a chance of illegal access to the Apple iPhone SE (2020) device and an increased risk of a security breach. Since it is directly built across the Apple iPhone SE (2020) device and its settings, this makes it a very hard-to-approach characteristic.

## Part 5. How to turn off two-factor authentication by removing Apple ID
