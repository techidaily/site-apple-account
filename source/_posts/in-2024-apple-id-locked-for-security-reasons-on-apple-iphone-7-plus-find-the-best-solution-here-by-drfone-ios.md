## Apple ID Locked for Security Reasons On Apple iPhone 7 Plus? Find the Best Solution Here

Has **your Apple ID been locked for security reasons**, and is this problem creating some tension for you? Before we move further towards its solutions, it's essential to know the reasons that lead to these problems. Some of them are explained below in a comprehensive manner:

### 1\. Incorrect Attempts

Apple locks your Apple ID mainly when you or someone else has entered the password incorrectly multiple times. This is one of the most common reasons, and mostly, this happens by the original users themselves unintentionally.

### 2\. Preventing Fraudulence

If there are unauthorized purchases or suspicious transactions on your ID, Apple may consider locking it to prevent that activity. It happens to protect the user's financial information and to avoid any fraudulent activity from being done on that Apple ID.

### 3\. Using Third-Party Tools

Sometimes, when using third-party tools based on open-source iCloud sources, the Apple ID could get locked. Developers can integrate iCloud features into their applications to provide users with improved accessibility to their iCloud data.

### 4\. Security Breach Reasons

The ID can also get locked when Apple senses a potential security breach, which could lead to the exposure of your credentials. It may occur when someone tries to hack your ID to get some information, especially when it is being used in multiple areas.

### 5\. Incorrect Security Questions

It may be due to the security questions you or someone else has entered incorrectly too many times. This is another common reason because, most often, the security questions are forgotten by the user. Ultimately, this leads to your Apple ID being locked for security reasons.

## Part 2. Resolving the Apple ID Locked Out For Security Reasons by Resetting The Password

**Step 1:** Go to the [Apple ID Account Page](https://appleid.apple.com/) and click “**Forgot Apple ID or Password**”.

![forgot apple id or password](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2020/05/forgot-apple-id-or-password.jpg)

**Step 2:** Enter your Apple ID and click “**Continue**”. In the next window, select “**I Need to Reset My Password**”.

**Step 3:** Now, select the method using which you want to reset the password. Here are the three possible options.

- If you’ve set up security questions while creating your Apple ID, you can choose “**Answer Security Questions**”. This method will only work if you remember all the answers to every security question. Once you select this method, you’ll be prompted to a new window, with all security questions. Answer these questions and follow the further instructions to reset your password.
- If you’ve added a recovery e-mail while creating your Apple ID, you can also use it to reset the password. In this case, select “**Get an E-mail**”. You’ll receive a password reset e-mail on your registered email.

    ![recovery email](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2020/05/recovery-email.jpg)

- Whichever recovery method you choose, make sure to follow the on-screen instructions carefully. Once your password reset process completes, you’ll have to individually update the password in every iCloud service, be it iTunes or iMessage.

In case you have enabled two-way verification on your Apple iPhone 7 Plus, you’ll receive a different screen after clicking “Forgot Apple ID or Password”. In this case, you’ll have to follow a different approach to reset your Apple ID password.

**Step 1:** Go to the Apple ID Account page and click “**Forgot ID or Password**”.

**Step 2:** Enter your Apple ID and select the “**Reset Password**” option.

**Step 3:** In the next window, you’ll be asked to enter the “**Recovery Key**”. This is a unique key that is provided when a user enables two-way verification for their iCloud account. Enter the recovery key and click “**Continue**”.

![enter recovery key](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2020/05/enter-recovery-key.jpg)

**Step 4:** Choose a trusted device to receive the verification code. Now, enter this verification code and click “**Continue**”.

**Step 5:** In the next window, enter a new password and tap “**Reset Password**”.

Once you’ve reset the password, you can easily sign out of the Apple ID by navigating through Settings>Apple ID>Sign Out on your Apple iPhone 7 Plus.
