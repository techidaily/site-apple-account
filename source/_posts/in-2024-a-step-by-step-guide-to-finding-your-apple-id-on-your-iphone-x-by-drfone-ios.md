- **On macOS**: Open **SystemPreferences**, select **Apple** **ID,** and click **Sign** **Out**. Sign in again.

### Reset Your Apple ID Password

Security concerns related to compromised credentials can contribute to the connection problem. If in doubt, initiate a password reset for your Apple ID. It not only enhances account security but also addresses authentication errors. Here's how.

### Disable VPN
