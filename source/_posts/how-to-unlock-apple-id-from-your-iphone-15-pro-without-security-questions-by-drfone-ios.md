To add a device to your Apple ID, you have to configure it first and log in with your existing ID from there. This is how it can be added to the Apple ID list of devices.

3. **How many devices can I add to My Apple ID?**

Apple ID allows you to connect ten devices under the same account. In these ten devices, there cannot be more than five computers associated with the Apple ID.

4. **Why can't I create a new Apple ID?**

If you are unable to create a new Apple ID, it is possible that you would have exceeded the maximum number of Apple IDs that can be set up with iCloud on one device.

5. **How can I Find My Apple ID password?**

There is no way to find your Apple ID password on your devices. If that is the case, you will have to reset the password or remember it so that you can use it for a purpose.
