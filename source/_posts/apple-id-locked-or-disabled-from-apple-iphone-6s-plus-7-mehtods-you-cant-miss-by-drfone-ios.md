## Apple ID Locked or Disabled On Apple iPhone 6s Plus? 7 Mehtods You Can't-Miss

Suppose, if you have forgotten the passcode and entered the wrong passcode six times, your Apple iPhone 6s Plus gets locked or has been disabled. According to your settings, if you have entered the wrong passcode too much time could even make your Apple iPhone 6s Plus delete all the data available.
