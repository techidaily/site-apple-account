### Unlock disabled Apple account using Apple's verification

The other method that can be effectively tested is Apple's verification that would allow us to easily topple off all barriers that are involved in the process. To effectively unlock your disabled Apple Account using Apple's verification process, you need to follow the steps described in detail.

**Step 1: Open iForgot Website**

You need to open the iForgot website to test the verification process. As you open the platform, provide the appropriate credentials over which your Apple device is operating. This is referred to as your Apple ID that has been used for the Apple iPhone 12 mini device.

**Step 2: Provide Personal Details**

As you proceed with the verification, there are several personal details that are used to check the authenticity of the user. You are required to answer all security questions, provide all numbers if asked.

**Step 3: Use the Verification Code**

The platform will send a verification code that would allow you to unlock your device with the Recovery Key that is offered. Tap on "Unable to access your \[device\]"? to allow the platform to send a six-digit verification to the phone number that is attached to the Apple ID. You can simply use it along with the Apple ID password to unlock your account.
