## Apple ID Locked or Disabled On Apple iPhone XS? 7 Mehtods You Can't-Miss

The Apple iPhone XS Apple ID will allow you to store and control data available on the Apple iPhone XS device; however, you need to re-generate the Apple iPhone XS passcode if you have forgotten the Apple iPhone XS passcode. Suppose, if you have forgotten the passcode and entered the wrong passcode six times, your Apple iPhone XS gets locked or has been disabled. According to your settings, if you have entered the wrong passcode too much time could even make your Apple iPhone XS delete all the data available.

This article will discuss how you can **unlock Apple ID** and remain secure. If you receive a message that you have entered the wrong passcode or forgotten your passcode, you have to follow some steps to regain access to your Apple Id.

Here are some common reasons why you might face difficulty logging out of the old Apple ID and their solutions:

### 1\. Ongoing iCloud Backup
