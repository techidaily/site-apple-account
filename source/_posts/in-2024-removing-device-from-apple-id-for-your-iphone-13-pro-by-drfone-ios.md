## Part 3. What does it influence when “Your account has been disabled in the App Store and iTunes”?

When you see the error message “Your account has been disabled in the App Store and iTunes” it often means the following:

- You cannot access Apple Books, App Store purchases, and even iTunes purchases.
- You may not have access to your iCloud account or any of the data stored in the account until you fix the problem.
- Furthermore, you may not be able to access Apple services and any Apple Store orders and repairs may need to be rescheduled.
- Until you can fix the issue, you will not be able to receive iMessage, FaceTime, and iCloud Mail.

## Part 4. Is “Your account has been disabled in the App Store and iTunes” the same as “Apple ID disabled”?

No. The error message “Your account has been disabled in the App Store and iTunes” differs from “Apple ID disabled”. You will primarily see the “Your account has been disabled in the App Store and iTunes” when you try to access content in the App Store. On the other hand, you may see the message “Apple ID disabled” when you enter the Apple ID and password to [bypass the iCloud Activation Lock screen](https://drfone.wondershare.com/icloud/bypass-icloud-activation.html).

![apple id disabled](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/05/apple-id-disabled.jpg)

After you see these errors, you will not be able to access some of the features and apps that require your Apple ID for access.

## Part 5. How to fix Apple ID disabled by removing Apple ID?

Sometimes the only way to [fix “Apple ID Disabled”](https://drfone.wondershare.com/apple-account/how-to-unlock-apple-id-disabled-activation-lock.html) is to remove the Apple ID from the Apple iPhone 13 Pro device. This may become a viable solution if you lost or forgot the Apple ID password or ID and you have no way to recover them. It is also one of the best solutions when you purchased a second-hand device, and you don’t know the Apple ID password for the account associated with the Apple iPhone 13 Pro device.
