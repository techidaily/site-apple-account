## Part 3: Sign Out of Apple ID Without Password by Resetting Your Apple ID Password

If you find yourself unable to recall your Apple ID password, you can reset it through a simple process. Here's how to sign out of your Apple ID without a password by resetting your Apple ID password:

**Step 1:** Access the Settings menu and select your name. Then, navigate to the Sign-In & Security section and choose the option labeled "Change Password.”

## Part 4: Sign Out of Apple ID without Password on Apple Web

Another convenient way how to sign out of Apple ID without the password is to reset the password of your Apple ID by tapping the “**Forgot Password**” option. In this case, however, you must remember all the security questions to reset your password successfully. If you don’t remember the security questions, you can also reset the recovery password using the registered e-mail ID.

Follow these instructions to reset your password and then sign out of the Apple ID.

**Step 1:** Go to the [Apple ID Account Page](https://appleid.apple.com/) and click “**Forgot Apple ID or Password**”.

**Step 2:** Enter your Apple ID and click “**Continue**”. In the next window, select “**I Need to Reset My Password**”.

**Step 3:** Now, select the method using which you want to reset the password. Here are the three possible options.

- If you’ve set up security questions while creating your Apple ID, you can choose “**Answer Security Questions**”. This method will only work if you remember all the answers to every security question. Once you select this method, you’ll be prompted to a new window, with all security questions. Answer these questions and follow the further instructions to reset your password.
- If you’ve added a recovery e-mail while creating your Apple ID, you can also use it to reset the password. In this case, select “**Get an E-mail**”. You’ll receive a password reset e-mail on your registered email.

    ![recovery email](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2020/05/recovery-email.jpg)

- Whichever recovery method you choose, make sure to follow the on-screen instructions carefully. Once your password reset process completes, you’ll have to individually update the password in every iCloud service, be it iTunes or iMessage.

In case you have enabled two-way verification on your Apple iPhone X, you’ll receive a different screen after clicking “Forgot Apple ID or Password”. In this case, you’ll have to follow a different approach to reset your Apple ID password.

**Step 1:** Go to the Apple ID Account page and click “**Forgot ID or Password**”.

**Step 2:** Enter your Apple ID and select the “**Reset Password**” option.

**Step 3:** In the next window, you’ll be asked to enter the “**Recovery Key**”. This is a unique key that is provided when a user enables two-way verification for their iCloud account. Enter the recovery key and click “**Continue**”.

![enter recovery key](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2020/05/enter-recovery-key.jpg)

**Step 4:** Choose a trusted device to receive the verification code. Now, enter this verification code and click “**Continue**”.

**Step 5:** In the next window, enter a new password and tap “**Reset Password**”.

Once you’ve reset the password, you can easily sign out of the Apple ID by navigating through Settings>Apple ID>Sign Out on your Apple iPhone X.

## Part 5: Sign Out of Apple ID without Password by Apple Support App

If you're unable to reset your Apple ID password on your own, you can seek assistance from Apple's official Support app. It provides expert guidance and troubleshooting. Here's how to use the Apple Support app to sign out of your Apple ID without a password:

**Step 1:** Access the Apple Support app on another Apple device. In case it's not available, you have the option to download the Apple Support app from the App Store. Scroll to the bottom until you find Support Tools, then select “Reset Password.” Here, opt for "A different Apple ID."

![choose a different apple id](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/11/sign-out-apple-id-7.jpg)

**Step 2:** Provide your Apple ID, and if your Apple ID slips your mind, you can attempt using your email address or phone number instead. Proceed by tapping “Next,” and adhere to the step-by-step guidelines on the screen to reset your password.
