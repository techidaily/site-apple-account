### Solution 2: Checking Apple System Status Page

Checking the Apple System Status page can help determine if the problem lies at Apple's end. The greying-out issue can be related to any ongoing server maintenance or outage. By staying informed about the status of Apple services, you can ensure that you can take the necessary steps. Follow these steps to check the Apple System Status page to check the **Apple ID greyed-out** status:

- **Step 1:** Start by accessing a web browser and opening the [<u>Apple System Status page</u>](https://www.apple.com/support/systemstatus/). Here, look for the entry named "Apple ID."

**Step 2:** When the indicator is green, there are no issues at the server's end. Yet, if it turns orange or red, it signifies a server problem, and you'll need to be patient until it's resolved.
