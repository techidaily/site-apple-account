Enable two-factor authentication for an extra layer of security. Use a complex and unique password. Use a mix of upper and lower-case letters, numbers, and symbols. Avoid using guessable information, like birthdays or common words.

### Update Your Apple ID Information

Keep your contact information, recovery email, and security questions up to date. This ensures you can regain access if you forget your password or face account-related issues.

### Check Your Account for Unusual Activities

Review your recent account activity. Look for unfamiliar devices or locations accessing your Apple ID. If you spot any suspicious actions, change your password and take necessary security measures.
