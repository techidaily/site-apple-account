**Step 2: Enter Screen Password**

Dr.Fone will not be able to detect your device just yet. You need to tap the “Trust this Computer” option on your phone, and then Dr.Fone will begin to access your device. It would help if you kept in mind that proceeding with this process will wipe all your Apple iPhone SE data.

**Step 3: Reset all your Apple iPhone SE Settings**

Dr.Fone will present a set of instructions for you to follow. Stick to these steps and reset all your Apple iPhone SE settings. Once this is done, the Apple iPhone SE will reboot, and the process to unlock your Apple iPhone SE will begin.

**Step 4: Unlock the iPhone**

The unlocking process will begin once your Apple iPhone SE has finished resetting. Removing the Apple ID from your phone will only take a couple of seconds.

Once the process is finished, make sure the Apple ID is no longer there. Proceed to your settings and check if Dr.Fone has removed the Apple ID.

## Part 2. Remove Apple ID from iPhone without Password with iCloud.com

It is better to possess more than one solution to a single issue, which could come in handy when the first one doesn’t work for you. To remove the Apple ID without the password would require you to use iCloud.

**Step 1.** Visit the iCloud website using your favorite browser. Once you are there, sign in through your Apple ID.

**Step 2.** Select the “Find iPhone” option to initiate removing the Apple ID from the Apple iPhone SE permanently.
