Also, note that if you restore your Apple iPhone 12 Pro from a local backup, the Activation Lock will re-enable.

To start this request, follow these steps:

- **Step 1:** Head to Apple's Activation Lock support page. (al-support.apple.com)
- **Step 2:** Scroll down the page, select the agreement checkbox, click **Continue**, and it will redirect you to a new page.
