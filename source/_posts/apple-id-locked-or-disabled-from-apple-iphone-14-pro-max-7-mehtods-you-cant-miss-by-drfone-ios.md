## Apple ID Locked or Disabled On Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max? 7 Mehtods You Can't-Miss

Apple ID refers to the authentication method available for the Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max device to compromise users' personal information and settings. The Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max Apple ID will allow you to store and control data available on the Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max device; however, you need to re-generate the Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max passcode if you have forgotten the Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max passcode. Suppose, if you have forgotten the passcode and entered the wrong passcode six times, your Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max gets locked or has been disabled. According to your settings, if you have entered the wrong passcode too much time could even make your Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max delete all the data available.

This article will discuss how you can **unlock Apple ID** and remain secure. If you receive a message that you have entered the wrong passcode or forgotten your passcode, you have to follow some steps to regain access to your Apple Id.

## Why Is Your Apple ID Locked or Disabled?

![apple id locked](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/03/apple-id-locked.png)

Some of the reasons causing your Apple ID locked or disabled are listed below:

- If you have entered the wrong passcode or security question too many times in a row, Apple ID gets locked. (Avoid entering the incorrect password more than 3 times)
- If you haven't used your Apple ID for an extended period, possibly making your Apple ID disabled or locked. When Apple modifies the requirement for passcode and security questions, you have not updated the information.

If you frequently change your Apple ID or passcode on the Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max device, Apple possibly considers that your Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max faces a security threat and might lock your Apple ID.

**Step 2:** You’ll be redirected to a new window displaying two different methods, i.e., “Answer Security Questions” an “Get an Email.” Choose a suitable method and follow the further steps to reset your password.

## Part 4: FAQs about Apple ID

1. **How to create a new Apple ID on an iPhone?**

Open the "App Store" and click the "Profile" icon on the top-right. You must continue clicking on the "Create New Apple ID" button after you have signed out of iCloud of your previous ID. Provide all required details for creating the Apple ID and confirm the process.

2. **How do I add a device to My Apple ID?**

To add a device to your Apple ID, you have to configure it first and log in with your existing ID from there. This is how it can be added to the Apple ID list of devices.

3. **How many devices can I add to My Apple ID?**

Apple ID allows you to connect ten devices under the same account. In these ten devices, there cannot be more than five computers associated with the Apple ID.

4. **Why can't I create a new Apple ID?**

If you are unable to create a new Apple ID, it is possible that you would have exceeded the maximum number of Apple IDs that can be set up with iCloud on one device.

5. **How can I Find My Apple ID password?**

There is no way to find your Apple ID password on your devices. If that is the case, you will have to reset the password or remember it so that you can use it for a purpose.
