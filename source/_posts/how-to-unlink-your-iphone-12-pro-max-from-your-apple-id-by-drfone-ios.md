**Step 5:** In the next window, you can reset the password. Simply, add the new password and click the “Reset Password” button.

Once the password is changed, you can easily delete your iCloud account by going to “Settings” > “iCloud” > “Delete Account”. Enter the new password and your iCloud account will be deleted permanently.

In case you haven’t enabled two-way verification for your iCloud account, there’s still a way to reset the password. However, you must remember the security questions that you answered or the recovery e-mail you had added while setting up your iCloud account.

**Step 1:** Open the Apple ID Account page and tap “Forgot Apple ID or Password”. Enter your Apple ID and select “I need to reset my password”.

**Step 2:** You’ll be redirected to a new window displaying two different methods, i.e., “Answer Security Questions” an “Get an Email.” Choose a suitable method and follow the further steps to reset your password.
