- Step 3: Select the iOS Firmware Version

Once the platform detects your device model, choose your system version and then click the "Start" button. The respective iOS firmware will start downloading, and Wondershare Dr.Fone will verify it once it is downloaded. Following this, click "Unlock Now," which will lead to a warning popup.

- Step 4: Conclude the Process To Unlock Your Apple ID

The warning informs you about the imminent data loss that will result during Apple ID unlocking. To confirm that you agree with the procedure, you are required to type in "000000" as the PIN code. Finally, click "Unlock" to start the Apple ID unlocking procedure. On its completion, hit the "Done" button to conclude the process.
