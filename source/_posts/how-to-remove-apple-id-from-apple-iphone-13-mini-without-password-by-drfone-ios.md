## Part 6: Using Apple's Two-step Verification (Forgot Apple Password)

Two-step authentication is an old Apple security feature and it still happens to be up and running. If you had set it up for your account, you can use it if you forgot Apple ID password. Here's how it works:

1. Go to the URL [iforgot.apple.com](http://iforgot.apple.com/).
2. Click the "Enter your Apple ID" option and type in your Apple ID to launch the recovery process.
3. You should be prompted to enter your recovery key. Type it in and click "Continue".

![check forgot apple id](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/elcapitan-apple-id-two-step-recovery-key.jpg)

2. Apple should send a verification code to the Apple iPhone 13 mini device you selected. Enter this code as requested on the website and click "Next".
3. After the verification is complete, you can now set up a new password and hopefully, you'll remember it this time.

1. An Apple ID password.
2. A trusted device that you can easily access.
3. The actual Recovery Key.

Now if you happen to lose any two of the above at the same time, there is no way of recovering your account and you simply have to create a new one.
