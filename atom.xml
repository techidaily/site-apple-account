Its robust verification features are a key reason why many people choose iPhones. Thus, its heightened security is highly valued. However, even extremely reliable systems can encounter hiccups.</p><p>Sometimes, you might need help with the issue of the <strong>Apple ID verification code not working</strong>. This leads to frustration, especially if you need to remember your Apple iPhone 15 Plus ID details. This 2024 guide will delve into practical solutions to fix issues with Apple ID verification codes, helping you <a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/icloud/how-recover-forgot-apple-id-password-from-icloud-itunes-and-app-store.html"><u>regain access </u> <u>t</u><u>o Apple ID</u></a> and peace of mind.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/apple-id-verification-not-working-01.jpg"                      alt="verification failed prompt apple"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-When-Does-the-Apple-Verification-ID-Failed-Prompt-Appear"><a href="#Part-1-When-Does-the-Apple-Verification-ID-Failed-Prompt-Appear" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: When Does the Apple Verification ID Failed Prompt Appear?"></a>Part 1: When Does the Apple Verification ID Failed Prompt Appear?</h2><p>Before diving into solutions, it’s essential to understand the various scenarios that can trigger the “<strong>Apple Verification ID Failed</strong>” prompt. Recognizing the cause of the problem is the first step toward the right fix. Let’s explore the common reasons you might encounter this issue:</p><h3 id="Wrong-Password-Input"><a href="#Wrong-Password-Input" class="headerlink" title="Wrong Password Input"></a>Wrong Password Input</h3><p>One of the most straightforward reasons for a failed verification is entering the wrong password. This could be a simple typing error or misremembering your password. Repeated wrong attempts can also lead to your account being temporarily disabled as a security measure.</p><h3 id="Apple-Server-Issues"><a href="#Apple-Server-Issues" class="headerlink" title="Apple Server Issues"></a>Apple Server Issues</h3><p>At times, the problem may not be on your end. Apple’s servers can experience downtime or technical glitches like any other online service. During such instances, verification processes might fail, as the server cannot authenticate your credentials.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/apple-id-verification-not-working-02.jpg"                      alt="apple server status page"                ></p><h3 id="Slow-Internet-or-Intermittent-Connection"><a href="#Slow-Internet-or-Intermittent-Connection" class="headerlink" title="Slow Internet or Intermittent Connection"></a>Slow Internet or Intermittent Connection</h3><p>A stable and reliable internet connection is improtant for the verification process. If your internet is slow or experiencing intermittent connectivity, it can disrupt the communication between your device and Apple’s servers, leading to verification failure.</p><h3 id="Two-Factor-Authentication-2FA-Issues"><a href="#Two-Factor-Authentication-2FA-Issues" class="headerlink" title="Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) Issues"></a>Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) Issues</h3><p>Apple’s two-factor authentication provides an extra layer of security. However, it can also be a source of problems. If there’s a delay in receiving the 2FA code or if <a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/android-issue/authentication-error.html"><u>2FA fails to work</u></a>, you won’t be able to complete the verification process. This could be due to network issues or, sometimes, glitches within the 2FA system itself.</p><h3 id="Suspicious-Activity"><a href="#Suspicious-Activity" class="headerlink" title="Suspicious Activity"></a>Suspicious Activity</h3><p>Apple takes your security seriously. If there’s any unusual activity detected on your account, such as login attempts from unfamiliar locations or devices, Apple might lock your account as a precaution. This can trigger the verification failed prompt as the system seeks to protect your account from potential unauthorized access.</p><p>By understanding these scenarios, you can diagnose better why you’re facing the issue of <strong>Apple verification ID not working</strong>. In the following sections, we will explore solutions tailored to these specific problems, helping you regain access to your account efficiently.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-To-Fix-Apple-ID-Verification-Failed"><a href="#Part-2-How-To-Fix-Apple-ID-Verification-Failed" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How To Fix Apple ID Verification Failed"></a>Part 2: How To Fix Apple ID Verification Failed</h2><p>Encountering an “<strong>Apple ID Verification Failed</strong>” error can be frustrating. Here are some practical solutions that correspond to the common reasons for this issue. These steps should help you regain access to your Apple ID.</p><h3 id="Method-1-Connecting-to-a-Stabler-Internet-Connection"><a href="#Method-1-Connecting-to-a-Stabler-Internet-Connection" class="headerlink" title="Method 1: Connecting to a Stabler Internet Connection"></a>Method 1: Connecting to a Stabler Internet Connection</h3><p>A stable internet connection is crucial. If you’re encountering issues, switch to a more reliable Wi-Fi network. Alternatively, toggling your Wi-Fi or mobile data off and back on can refresh your connection.</p><h3 id="Method-2-Changing-Password-2FA-Device-Using-Apple-ID-Account"><a href="#Method-2-Changing-Password-2FA-Device-Using-Apple-ID-Account" class="headerlink" title="Method 2: Changing Password&#x2F;2FA Device Using Apple ID Account"></a>Method 2: Changing Password&#x2F;2FA Device Using Apple ID Account</h3><p>If you’re facing troubles due to password errors or 2FA issues, resetting your password or updating 2FA settings may help.

Their style and presentation were not the only reason that made people look forward to buying an iPhone. Apple created its own operating system and presented their own versions of security and protection. One of the most recognized and impeccable features offered by Apple in its innovative structure was the security and safety through Apple ID and Apple Account. Every important feature that operated throughout the Apple iPhone 15 Plus or iPad was focused over a single entity, the Apple ID. However, apart from the Apple ID, there were several other layers of authentications and verifications that were added throughout the protocol structure. A couple of them are renowned as Two Factor Verification and Two Factor Authentication. This article produces a very generous set of advice that should be looked over while handing these layers of protection. To get a better understanding of the procedures involved, you need to look over the guide to gain better knowledge on how to turn off Two Factor Authentication on your Apple.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2020/11/two-factor-authentication-apple.jpg"                      alt="two factor authentication apple"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-Is-two-step-verification-the-same-as-two-factor-authentication"><a href="#Part-1-Is-two-step-verification-the-same-as-two-factor-authentication" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. Is two-step verification the same as two-factor authentication?"></a>Part 1. Is two-step verification the same as two-factor authentication?</h2><p>There might be a few differences involved in these two security models; however, it should be kept in mind that they focus their purpose on securing the Apple ID of the user. Two Factor Verification is a security protocol that protects access to the various activities performed through the Apple ID. It attenuates an extra verification step across the Apple iPhone 15 Plus device in addition to the password for the Apple ID. The device receives a verification code from an authentication factor that allows the authorities to confirm the credibility of the user.</p><p>The Two Factor Authentication is considered as an upgrade to the Two Factor Verification, which was released two years after the Two Factor Verification, in 2015. This authentication method exempted the offline recovery keys and application-specific passcodes. They added a six-digit authentication code onto the original password and produced an offline, time-dependent code that is to be generated through the Settings of the trusted device of the user. This feature was appended into the iOS 9 and OS X El Capitan with a region-specific target.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-turn-off-two-step-verification"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-turn-off-two-step-verification" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. How to turn off two-step verification?"></a>Part 2. How to turn off two-step verification?</h2><p>As you are aware of the Two-Step Verification process, it is quite easy and typical in configuring. However, when it comes to turning the settings off, it is also a simple and straightforward procedure that can be easily covered by following the steps provided below.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> You are required to open the Apple ID Account web page on your browser and sign in with your Apple ID credentials.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> As you log into the website, access the “Security” section, and tap “Edit” from the options provided on the list.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Tap on the “Two-Step Verification” option and turn it off. Confirm to conclude the process. You may be required to select the new security questions and verify the data of birth in the process. As you would be done with it, an email would be received across your connected address for confirmation.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2082538/7443" target="_top" id="2082538"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2082538"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2082538/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-turn-off-two-factor-authentication-lower-than-iOS-10-3"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-turn-off-two-factor-authentication-lower-than-iOS-10-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 3. How to turn off two-factor authentication? (lower than iOS 10.3)"></a>Part 3. How to turn off two-factor authentication? (lower than iOS 10.3)</h2><p>Two Factor Authentication cannot be turned off in a few cases and accounts for iOS versions greater than 10.3. However, if you have activated Two Factor Authentication across the iOS versions lower than 10.3, you can deactivate the feature through a series of simple steps. The exemption of this security feature across your device leaves it protected only through a password and a few security questions. For turning off the Two Factor Authentication from your Apple device, you need to follow the steps provided as follows:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open your browser and access your Apple ID Account website. Provide the details of your Apple ID and log in.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Tap on “Edit” in the “Security” section and turn off the “Two Factor Authentication” option.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> This would lead you to set new security questions for the Apple ID account, followed by a verification of your date of birth. The successful execution of the process would lead to turning it off.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://store.iobit.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=1468905&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/184260348236f9554fe9375772ff966e/ascscan_728x90.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-4-Why-can’t-you-turn-off-two-factor-authentication-if-you-already-use-it-iOS-10-3-and-later"><a href="#Part-4-Why-can’t-you-turn-off-two-factor-authentication-if-you-already-use-it-iOS-10-3-and-later" class="headerlink" title="Part 4. Why can’t you turn off two-factor authentication if you already use it? (iOS 10.3 and later)"></a>Part 4. Why can’t you turn off two-factor authentication if you already use it? (iOS 10.3 and later)</h2><p>For users who have an Apple device with an iOS 10.3 or later version, they cannot turn the Two Factor Authentication off after it is accessed. The latest iOS and macOS included extra layers of security in their features, which led towards a better security foundation and protection of information. Users who have updated their account information can unenroll in two weeks after updating. For this, you are required to simply access the confirmation email that you have received and tap on the link to approach the previous security settings. Thus, it makes it far more than impossible for users to turn their Two Factor Authentication off if they consider it unnecessary for their device. This feature is something that would always remain intact with their device as an extra layer of security. Its absence does leave a chance of illegal access to the Apple iPhone 15 Plus device and an increased risk of a security breach. Since it is directly built across the Apple iPhone 15 Plus device and its settings, this makes it a very hard-to-approach characteristic.</p><h2 id="Part-5-How-to-turn-off-two-factor-authentication-by-removing-Apple-ID"><a href="#Part-5-How-to-turn-off-two-factor-authentication-by-removing-Apple-ID" class="headerlink" title="Part 5. How to turn off two-factor authentication by removing Apple ID"></a>Part 5. How to turn off two-factor authentication by removing Apple ID</h2><p>Users who are very reluctant to remove the two-factor authentication off their device can consider removing the Apple ID itself for fulfilling the purpose. However, when it comes to executing such tasks, the need for a third-party platform gets evident. Third-party platforms provided dedicated services in providing users with a unique platform of operation with an environment that suits their purpose perfectly. Many platforms provide such impressive services, yet the selection gets quite difficult for a series of reasons. The following pointers explain the reasons to the users over why they should focus on selecting a platform such as <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/iphone-unlock/" >Dr. Fone – Screen Unlock (iOS) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for this purpose.</p><ul><li>You need to have no excessive knowledge of handling the platform.</li><li>You can cover all the dynamics of unlocking the Apple iPhone 15 Plus device without the use of iTunes.</li><li>The platform provides you with the ability to unlock the passcode of your Apple device with ease.</li><li>It offers you to protect your device from the disabled state.</li><li>Works across all models of iPhone, iPad, and iPod Touch.</li><li>Provides services to the latest version of iOS.</li></ul><p>Dr. Fone – Screen Unlock (iOS) makes it easy for the users to control and remove their Apple ID and disable the two-factor authentication across their device.

Once the platform is done with the process, it provides a prompt message in the next window displaying the execution of the removal of Apple ID from your device. This also removes the Two Factor Authentication off your device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/remove-apple-id-8.png"                      alt="complete"                ></p><h2 id="Conclusion-2"><a href="#Conclusion-2" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>The article has presented a very detailed comparison of the Two Factor Verification and Two Factor Authentication and provided an elaborated discussion over how to turn these security features off their devices.

This starts with the quality of hardware and the synergy with the software that runs the hardware, and the user experience you get. Apple puts great emphasis on this, and rightly so, for this is one of the keys defining and differentiating factors for people to choose Apple’s iOS over Google’s Android. Like with all good things in life, sometimes, a spanner is put in the works that bring your smooth-sailing life to an abrupt halt. With smartphones playing pivotal roles in our lives today, from payments to internet experiences to getting work done to stay in touch with people, anything that stops us from using our smartphone or endangers that experience is a cause for worry. A locked Apple ID is one such thing. It does not happen frequently, in fact, most users will never experience a locked Apple ID, but for the ones who are fortunate enough to have such a rare experience in life, help is at hand. All you need to do is relax and read on. By the end of it, you will have an unlocked Apple ID and you can go back to cruising.</p><h2 id="Part-I-Difference-Between-Activation-Lock-and-Locked-Apple-ID"><a href="#Part-I-Difference-Between-Activation-Lock-and-Locked-Apple-ID" class="headerlink" title="Part I: Difference Between Activation Lock and Locked Apple ID"></a>Part I: Difference Between Activation Lock and Locked Apple ID</h2><p>Apple being Apple, does a lot to make sure that users get the smoothest experience possible when interacting with their Apple products, both hardware, and software. Yet, sometimes, the messaging gets confusing, and people are not sure what is what. One such thing is the difference between iCloud Activation Lock and Apple ID Lock. While people are more likely to encounter Activation Lock and less likely to encounter Apple ID Lock, they are often confused when they encounter Apple ID Lock and struggle to figure out what that means and how to resolve the issue.</p><p>Activation Lock is when your supported Apple device is locked for a number of reasons. The most common reason is a stolen device that was locked by its owner, however, there are other perfectly valid reasons such as an outgoing employee forgetting to sign out and erase their Apple device before submitting it back. The IT department would not be able to reset that device without turning off Find My Apple iPhone 15 Plus and Activation Lock on the Apple iPhone 15 Plus device.</p><p>A locked Apple ID usually happens when the user has forgotten their password to their Apple ID account and attempts to figure out the password have been unsuccessful. Sometimes, Apple ID gets locked automatically under some conditions, and that requires users to reset their password to gain access. A locked Apple ID does not mean that your device is locked for your use. You can keep using it so long as you do not try to use another Apple ID with it since to do that you would have to sign out of your current Apple ID (which is locked) and you won’t be able to do that. On the other hand, Activation Lock renders the entire device unusable till the lock is cleared.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/10/unlock-apple-id-on-iphone-13-3.jpg"                      alt="apple id locked message"                ></p><p>In short, Apple ID Lock is about a user’s account with Apple, akin to how Google Account works on Android devices. Apple ID Lock locks a user’s account with Apple while retaining complete usage of the Apple iPhone 15 Plus device whereas Activation Lock locks the Apple iPhone 15 Plus device and prevents anyone from using it until the correct credentials are entered. This is about verifying the ownership of the Apple iPhone 15 Plus device and works to deter theft of Apple devices.</p><h2 id="Part-II-Checking-If-Your-Apple-ID-Is-Locked"><a href="#Part-II-Checking-If-Your-Apple-ID-Is-Locked" class="headerlink" title="Part II: Checking If Your Apple ID Is Locked"></a>Part II: Checking If Your Apple ID Is Locked</h2><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://turtlebeachus.sjv.io/c/5597632/1988416/23719" target="_top" id="1988416"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/23719-1988416"                      border="0" alt="" width="600" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1988416/23719"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/10/unlock-apple-id-on-iphone-13-4.jpg"                      alt="the message of apple id locked"                ></p><p>A locked Apple ID is rather unmistakable. Your device would keep telling you that your Apple ID is locked for your security. Your Apple ID could be locked or disabled altogether if someone has tried to gain access to your account (and, obviously, failed). Apple would disable access to the Apple ID unless you are able to prove rightful ownership and reset the password successfully.</p><h2 id="Part-III-Reasons-for-Locked-Apple-ID"><a href="#Part-III-Reasons-for-Locked-Apple-ID" class="headerlink" title="Part III: Reasons for Locked Apple ID"></a>Part III: Reasons for Locked Apple ID</h2><p>There can be a few reasons why your Apple ID is locked. You forgot the password and now it is locked since you entered the wrong password too many times. A scarier prospect, albeit a real one, is that some malicious actor attempted to login into your Apple ID account but failed. Had they succeeded, you would have gotten a message that ‘your Apple ID is being used on another device’ now.</p><p>Apple does a lot to ensure that your Apple ID remains safe. You trust Apple with a lot of your data, including financial data by way of your credit cards associated with Apple ID to make purchases on the App Store and iTunes Store. Therefore, some of the time, Apple preempts issues by proactively locking up your Apple ID or even disabling it. It goes without saying that sometimes it is something so simple as a software error that is believed to have locked up Apple IDs for many users around the world a while ago. It is also entirely possible that it was some malicious actor probing the servers for accounts.</p><p>All of these will result in a locked Apple ID that users will have to reset their password to in order to gain access back.</p><h2 id="Part-IV-How-to-Unlock-Apple-ID-on-Apple-iPhone-15-Plus"><a href="#Part-IV-How-to-Unlock-Apple-ID-on-Apple-iPhone-15-Plus" class="headerlink" title="Part IV: How to Unlock Apple ID on Apple iPhone 15 Plus"></a>Part IV: How to Unlock Apple ID on Apple iPhone 15 Plus</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/10/unlock-apple-id-on-iphone-13-1.jpg"                      alt="apple id webpage"                ></p><p>It is unfortunate you are facing a locked Apple ID. Apple tries its best to make users aware of safety protocols they need to follow to minimize and mitigate such unfortunate occurrences, such as using two-factor authentication, trusted devices, trusted phone numbers, passwords, passcodes, etc. that serve as deterrents to prevent unauthorized access to devices and accounts. Yet, when the unfortunate happens, what to do?</p><h3 id="IV-I-Unlock-Apple-ID-Via-Two-Factor-Authentication"><a href="#IV-I-Unlock-Apple-ID-Via-Two-Factor-Authentication" class="headerlink" title="IV.I: Unlock Apple ID Via Two-Factor Authentication"></a>IV.I: Unlock Apple ID Via Two-Factor Authentication</h3><p>Apple implemented two-factor authentication a long time ago to prevent unauthorized access to Apple ID accounts.

Here are some common reasons why you might face difficulty logging out of the old Apple ID and their solutions:</p><h3 id="1-Ongoing-iCloud-Backup"><a href="#1-Ongoing-iCloud-Backup" class="headerlink" title="1. Ongoing iCloud Backup"></a>1. Ongoing iCloud Backup</h3><p>While the data is backed up on the iCloud from your Mac, you cannot log out from the Apple ID.

These issues can usually be resolved with software updates or troubleshooting steps.</p><h4 id="Solution-1"><a href="#Solution-1" class="headerlink" title="Solution"></a>Solution</h4><p>To resolve the bugs and glitches within the MacBook, the best option is to update macOS to its latest version. For that, access “System Settings” through Dock and move to the “General” tab. Here, select “<a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/iphone-data-recovery/recover-lost-date-after-ios-17-update.html"><u>Software Update</u></a>“ to verify if an update is available and if an update is available, use “Update Now” to update the macOS.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/10/change-apple-id-on-mac-8.jpg"                      alt="press the update now button"                ></p><h3 id="3-Apple-Server-Inactivity"><a href="#3-Apple-Server-Inactivity" class="headerlink" title="3.

Recognizing the cause of the problem is the first step toward the right fix. Let’s explore the common reasons you might encounter this issue:</p><h3 id="Wrong-Password-Input"><a href="#Wrong-Password-Input" class="headerlink" title="Wrong Password Input"></a>Wrong Password Input</h3><p>One of the most straightforward reasons for a failed verification is entering the wrong password. This could be a simple typing error or misremembering your password. Repeated wrong attempts can also lead to your account being temporarily disabled as a security measure.</p><h3 id="Apple-Server-Issues"><a href="#Apple-Server-Issues" class="headerlink" title="Apple Server Issues"></a>Apple Server Issues</h3><p>At times, the problem may not be on your end. Apple’s servers can experience downtime or technical glitches like any other online service. During such instances, verification processes might fail, as the server cannot authenticate your credentials.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/apple-id-verification-not-working-02.jpg"                      alt="apple server status page"                ></p><h3 id="Slow-Internet-or-Intermittent-Connection"><a href="#Slow-Internet-or-Intermittent-Connection" class="headerlink" title="Slow Internet or Intermittent Connection"></a>Slow Internet or Intermittent Connection</h3><p>A stable and reliable internet connection is improtant for the verification process. If your internet is slow or experiencing intermittent connectivity, it can disrupt the communication between your device and Apple’s servers, leading to verification failure.</p><h3 id="Two-Factor-Authentication-2FA-Issues"><a href="#Two-Factor-Authentication-2FA-Issues" class="headerlink" title="Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) Issues"></a>Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) Issues</h3><p>Apple’s two-factor authentication provides an extra layer of security. However, it can also be a source of problems. If there’s a delay in receiving the 2FA code or if <a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/android-issue/authentication-error.html"><u>2FA fails to work</u></a>, you won’t be able to complete the verification process. This could be due to network issues or, sometimes, glitches within the 2FA system itself.</p><h3 id="Suspicious-Activity"><a href="#Suspicious-Activity" class="headerlink" title="Suspicious Activity"></a>Suspicious Activity</h3><p>Apple takes your security seriously. If there’s any unusual activity detected on your account, such as login attempts from unfamiliar locations or devices, Apple might lock your account as a precaution. This can trigger the verification failed prompt as the system seeks to protect your account from potential unauthorized access.</p><p>By understanding these scenarios, you can diagnose better why you’re facing the issue of <strong>Apple verification ID not working</strong>. In the following sections, we will explore solutions tailored to these specific problems, helping you regain access to your account efficiently.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-To-Fix-Apple-ID-Verification-Failed"><a href="#Part-2-How-To-Fix-Apple-ID-Verification-Failed" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How To Fix Apple ID Verification Failed"></a>Part 2: How To Fix Apple ID Verification Failed</h2><p>Encountering an “<strong>Apple ID Verification Failed</strong>” error can be frustrating.

You are locked out of App Store, iCloud and iTunes, literally all of Apple. It becomes impossible to view your files on iCloud or to download anything from App store or iTunes if you forgot Apple ID password. Well luckily, you are not the first person to forget Apple ID or <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/reset-iphone/how-to-reset-iphone-password.html" >forgot iPhone password <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. You can rest it easy because we have prepared this guide just for you.</p><p>In this guide, we will uncover all the safeguards that Apple has put in place to help you recover your Apple account. We will walk you through 5 methods of how you can reset your password or recover your Apple ID from any web browser or iOS device.</p><h2 id="Part-1-A-Preliminary-Check"><a href="#Part-1-A-Preliminary-Check" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: A Preliminary Check"></a>Part 1: A Preliminary Check</h2><p>Before doing anything else, it may just happen that you have not forgotten Apple ID password but you are just making a small mistake when signing in to your account. Here is a quick checklist you should review before subjecting yourself to a meaningless hassle:</p><ol><li>Turn off your Caps Lock as you type in your password unless you have uppercase letters in your password of course.</li><li>If you have more than one email address, you could sometimes get them mixed up so review the email you are using to sign in. You could also have made a spelling mistake in your email address.</li><li>Lastly, your sign in attempts may be fruitless because your account has been disabled for security reasons. In this case you should receive a notification asking you to reset your password so go over your emails.</li></ol><p>If none of the above solutions work, you can safely conclude that you forgot Apple ID password but not to worry, we’ve has got you covered. Also, before we proceed with any solutions, it’s better to <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/backup-iphone/backup-locked-iphone-data.html" >backup iPhone without passcode <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, to invoid any data loss during the process.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Recover-or-Reset-Forgotten-Apple-ID-or-Password-on-iPhone-iPad"><a href="#Part-2-Recover-or-Reset-Forgotten-Apple-ID-or-Password-on-iPhone-iPad" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Recover or Reset Forgotten Apple ID or Password on iPhone&#x2F;iPad"></a>Part 2: Recover or Reset Forgotten Apple ID or Password on iPhone&#x2F;iPad</h2><p>The following is the first method you should try out to log back into your Apple account. This is because even though it isn’t a guaranteed method, it is the simplest method by which to recover forgotten Apple ID.</p><ol><li>In your iOS device, go to Settings, then scroll down to “iCloud.”</li><li>Tap on the email address, which is at the top of the iCloud screen.</li><li>Tap on “Forgot Apple ID or Password?” Now you have one of two options:</li></ol><ul><li>• If you forgot the Password, type your Apple ID, and click “Next.”</li><li>• If you forgot the Apple ID, then click on “Forgot your Apple ID?” You’ll have to enter your full name and details, and then you’ll receive your Apple ID.</li></ul><ol start="5"><li>You’ll have to answer your security questions to receive your Apple ID.</li></ol><p>However, this process will only work if you know either your Apple ID, or your Password, and the answers to your security questions. If not, then you can follow the next methods.</p><p>You May Like: <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/reset-iphone/reset-iphone-without-apple-id.html" >How to Reset iPhone Without Apple ID &gt;&gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="Part-3-Recover-Reset-Apple-Password-via-Email-or-Security-Questions"><a href="#Part-3-Recover-Reset-Apple-Password-via-Email-or-Security-Questions" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Recover&#x2F;Reset Apple Password via Email or Security Questions"></a>Part 3: Recover&#x2F;Reset Apple Password via Email or Security Questions</h2><p>This method only works if you have a verified recovery email for your Apple account or a set of security questions that you set up.

How to Fix"></a>Why Apple Account Disabled On your Apple iPhone 15 Plus? How to Fix</h2><p>Apple is one of the leading smartphone developing enterprises that has introduced the world to a contemporary set of features that are not common among other leading smartphone companies. One of the major distinguishing characteristics of Apple has been displayed in its present security protocols. Apple Account is regarded as one of the most significant credentials of the Apple iPhone 15 Plus and iPad that is responsible for connecting and holding the applications and the assorted data. Many users have generally reported unusual situations that got their Apple Account disabled. There are several reasons that can be associated with the Apple account getting disabled. The major repercussion that is associated with it is unnecessary data loss following the suspension of all products that have been bought with the account over time. This article provides you an impressive overview of the major reasons that lead to your Apple Account getting disabled, followed by the associated mechanisms that can be tested to secure the account.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Why-is-the-Apple-account-disabled"><a href="#Part-1-Why-is-the-Apple-account-disabled" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. Why is the Apple account disabled?"></a>Part 1. Why is the Apple account disabled?</h2><p>Apple iPhone, iPad, and other devices operate over a single Operating System, with its own protocols and unique mechanisms that distinguish it from other smartphone models in the market. Apple believes in securing the data and identification of its users with its state-of-the-art security measures. Under such circumstances, it usually gets possible for the user to have his Apple account disabled unnecessarily. Whenever you encounter such a situation, there are several messages that might be displayed on your device to prompt you over the disabling of the account. These messages usually appear in situations where you intend to sign in to some platform with your associated Apple ID. The most common messages that appear on the screen are:</p><ul><li>“This Apple ID has been disabled for security reasons.”</li><li>“You can’t sign in because your account was disabled for security reasons.”</li><li>“This Apple ID has been locked for security reasons.”</li></ul><p>The messages that have been stated above are usually depicting a security anomaly that led to the disabling of the associated Apple ID. However, there can be several reasons that would have led to such circumstances, which are described as follows.</p><ul><li>There might be incorrect forced logging in into your Apple ID for multiple tries.</li><li>Any user would have entered incorrect security questions multiple times.</li><li>The other information associated with the Apple ID would have been entered incorrectly numerous times.</li></ul><h2 id="Part-2-Is-“Your-account-has-been-disabled-in-the-App-Store-and-iTunes”-the-same-as-“This-Apple-ID-has-been-disabled-for-security-reasons”"><a href="#Part-2-Is-“Your-account-has-been-disabled-in-the-App-Store-and-iTunes”-the-same-as-“This-Apple-ID-has-been-disabled-for-security-reasons”" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. Is “Your account has been disabled in the App Store and iTunes” the same as “This Apple ID has been disabled for security reasons”?"></a>Part 2. Is “Your account has been disabled in the App Store and iTunes” the same as “This Apple ID has been disabled for security reasons”?</h2><p>There are several instances where you encounter such prompt messages where you are restricted in using the App Store and iTunes. These messages can come in the form of “Your account has been disabled in the App Store and iTunes.” Over observing this prompt message, it has been discovered that the assorted message is not related to the other common message of “This Apple ID has been disabled for security reasons.” The dynamics of getting restricted from using the App Store and iTunes are related to remaining balances that have stuck around for a while over your Apple account. Normally, you may have some billing issues that are prevailing over an unpaid iTunes or App Store order. This problem can be countered through simplistic methods under such conditions where you are having access to the account information and can check for the basic billing information or update the payment method following other settings that are associated with paying bills. Over failure in accessing your account, you are required to contact Apple Support and look for the billing and payment statements to clear up all the remaining dues. Apple has considered covering all the security protocols to perfection, where you have any prevailing Apple charges on your connected credit card that would lead to direct disabling of your Apple Account.</p><p>Even though Apple accounts can be generally disabled overpayment issues, there are several security reasons that might restrict you in discovering and buying different products across the App Store and iTunes. It is necessary for you, as an Apple user, to remain prompt of all the issues that are relating to your Apple Account.</p><h2 id="Part-3-2-tips-to-Unlock-Disabled-Apple-Account"><a href="#Part-3-2-tips-to-Unlock-Disabled-Apple-Account" class="headerlink" title="Part 3. 2 tips to Unlock Disabled Apple Account"></a>Part 3. 2 tips to Unlock Disabled Apple Account</h2><p>As this article provides you a detailed overview of the reasons that lead to your Apple Account getting disabled, this article also considers providing you a few tips and tricks that would guide you in efficiently unlocking your Apple Account and use it with ease.</p><h3 id="Unlock-disabled-Apple-account-with-Dr-Fone"><a href="#Unlock-disabled-Apple-account-with-Dr-Fone" class="headerlink" title="Unlock disabled Apple account with Dr. Fone"></a>Unlock disabled Apple account with Dr. Fone</h3><p>The first remedy that can be effectively tested across such situations that involve disabled Apple accounts is relating a third-party platform.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="How-to-Fix-Locked-Apple-ID-on-Apple-iPhone-15-Plus"><a href="#How-to-Fix-Locked-Apple-ID-on-Apple-iPhone-15-Plus" class="headerlink" title="How to Fix Locked Apple ID on Apple iPhone 15 Plus"></a>How to Fix Locked Apple ID on Apple iPhone 15 Plus</h2><p>Part of why you own and use Apple devices is the reliability of the Apple iPhone 15 Plus devices and the ease of using them. This starts with the quality of hardware and the synergy with the software that runs the hardware, and the user experience you get. Apple puts great emphasis on this, and rightly so, for this is one of the keys defining and differentiating factors for people to choose Apple’s iOS over Google’s Android. Like with all good things in life, sometimes, a spanner is put in the works that bring your smooth-sailing life to an abrupt halt. With smartphones playing pivotal roles in our lives today, from payments to internet experiences to getting work done to stay in touch with people, anything that stops us from using our smartphone or endangers that experience is a cause for worry. A locked Apple ID is one such thing. It does not happen frequently, in fact, most users will never experience a locked Apple ID, but for the ones who are fortunate enough to have such a rare experience in life, help is at hand. All you need to do is relax and read on. By the end of it, you will have an unlocked Apple ID and you can go back to cruising.</p><h2 id="Part-I-Difference-Between-Activation-Lock-and-Locked-Apple-ID"><a href="#Part-I-Difference-Between-Activation-Lock-and-Locked-Apple-ID" class="headerlink" title="Part I: Difference Between Activation Lock and Locked Apple ID"></a>Part I: Difference Between Activation Lock and Locked Apple ID</h2><p>Apple being Apple, does a lot to make sure that users get the smoothest experience possible when interacting with their Apple products, both hardware, and software. Yet, sometimes, the messaging gets confusing, and people are not sure what is what. One such thing is the difference between iCloud Activation Lock and Apple ID Lock. While people are more likely to encounter Activation Lock and less likely to encounter Apple ID Lock, they are often confused when they encounter Apple ID Lock and struggle to figure out what that means and how to resolve the issue.</p><p>Activation Lock is when your supported Apple device is locked for a number of reasons. The most common reason is a stolen device that was locked by its owner, however, there are other perfectly valid reasons such as an outgoing employee forgetting to sign out and erase their Apple device before submitting it back. The IT department would not be able to reset that device without turning off Find My Apple iPhone 15 Plus and Activation Lock on the Apple iPhone 15 Plus device.</p><p>A locked Apple ID usually happens when the user has forgotten their password to their Apple ID account and attempts to figure out the password have been unsuccessful. Sometimes, Apple ID gets locked automatically under some conditions, and that requires users to reset their password to gain access. A locked Apple ID does not mean that your device is locked for your use. You can keep using it so long as you do not try to use another Apple ID with it since to do that you would have to sign out of your current Apple ID (which is locked) and you won’t be able to do that. On the other hand, Activation Lock renders the entire device unusable till the lock is cleared.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/10/unlock-apple-id-on-iphone-13-3.jpg"                      alt="apple id locked message"                ></p><p>In short, Apple ID Lock is about a user’s account with Apple, akin to how Google Account works on Android devices. Apple ID Lock locks a user’s account with Apple while retaining complete usage of the Apple iPhone 15 Plus device whereas Activation Lock locks the Apple iPhone 15 Plus device and prevents anyone from using it until the correct credentials are entered. This is about verifying the ownership of the Apple iPhone 15 Plus device and works to deter theft of Apple devices.</p><h2 id="Part-II-Checking-If-Your-Apple-ID-Is-Locked"><a href="#Part-II-Checking-If-Your-Apple-ID-Is-Locked" class="headerlink" title="Part II: Checking If Your Apple ID Is Locked"></a>Part II: Checking If Your Apple ID Is Locked</h2><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://printrendy.pxf.io/c/5597632/1453719/17020" target="_top" id="1453719"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17020-1453719"                      border="0" alt="" width="300" height="250"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1453719/17020"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/10/unlock-apple-id-on-iphone-13-4.jpg"                      alt="the message of apple id locked"                ></p><p>A locked Apple ID is rather unmistakable. Your device would keep telling you that your Apple ID is locked for your security. Your Apple ID could be locked or disabled altogether if someone has tried to gain access to your account (and, obviously, failed). Apple would disable access to the Apple ID unless you are able to prove rightful ownership and reset the password successfully.</p><h2 id="Part-III-Reasons-for-Locked-Apple-ID"><a href="#Part-III-Reasons-for-Locked-Apple-ID" class="headerlink" title="Part III: Reasons for Locked Apple ID"></a>Part III: Reasons for Locked Apple ID</h2><p>There can be a few reasons why your Apple ID is locked. You forgot the password and now it is locked since you entered the wrong password too many times. A scarier prospect, albeit a real one, is that some malicious actor attempted to login into your Apple ID account but failed. Had they succeeded, you would have gotten a message that ‘your Apple ID is being used on another device’ now.</p><p>Apple does a lot to ensure that your Apple ID remains safe. You trust Apple with a lot of your data, including financial data by way of your credit cards associated with Apple ID to make purchases on the App Store and iTunes Store. Therefore, some of the time, Apple preempts issues by proactively locking up your Apple ID or even disabling it.

However, after enabling the function, many iPhone users forget to remove it from the FindMy app ahead of time. Therefore, if you are selling or resetting the Apple iPhone 15 Plus device, you need to <strong>remove AirTag from Apple ID</strong> to be usable later.</p><p>If someone removes the AirTag without resetting it while operating in the Bluetooth range, deleting AirTag ownership will require manually breaking the Apple iPhone 15 Plus device apart and further configuration.</p><p>Remove this connection from the Apple ID account with simple steps first-hand to avoid that. Read on to know the steps involved in this process directly or with the best software alternative.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/01/how-to-remove-airtag-from-apple-id-1.jpg"                      alt="remove airtag on iphone"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-Exactly-Does-an-AirTag-Do"><a href="#Part-1-What-Exactly-Does-an-AirTag-Do" class="headerlink" title="Part 1.

What Exactly Does an AirTag Do?</h2><p>Before discussing <strong>how to remove AirTag from Apple ID,</strong> you should know better about the function itself. The AirTag feature is available for iOS devices. Therefore, one can register the AirTag process with the Apple ID you are utilizing on your smartphone.</p><p>Apple users can attach the AirTag to different objects like backpacks or keychains. This makes it simple to find these objects later in case they get misplaced or lost through the Find My app on the iPhone.</p><p>Users can add their AirTag to one Apple ID account, so you cannot access this from the Find My app via other accounts. In case of loss, you must remove the AirTag from your device entirely.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/01/how-to-remove-airtag-from-apple-id-2.jpg"                      alt="airtag model"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Remove-an-AirTag-from-Your-Apple-ID-onApple-iPhone-15-Plus-iPad"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Remove-an-AirTag-from-Your-Apple-ID-onApple-iPhone-15-Plus-iPad" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

How to Remove an AirTag from Your Apple ID onApple iPhone 15 Plus &amp; iPad?</h2><p>After adding the AirTag to any object, it instantly syncs with the Apple ID of the user. So, only the primary Apple ID user can use or monitor the AirTagged item. Other users can use it only after resetting the AirTag. So, learn <strong>how to remove AirTag from Apple ID</strong> via the Find My app on different iOS device types.</p><h3 id="Version-1-Removing-AirTag-on-iPhone"><a href="#Version-1-Removing-AirTag-on-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Version 1: Removing AirTag on iPhone"></a>Version 1: Removing AirTag on iPhone</h3><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Access the Apple iPhone 15 Plus homepage and access the Find My app.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> From the bottom menu bar, tap on the Items option.</p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: The information about which AirTag is associated with your chosen item will appear in the next page list.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/01/how-to-remove-airtag-from-apple-id-3.jpg"                      alt="information about the item of choice"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Choose the selected items and swipe upwards on the screen.
