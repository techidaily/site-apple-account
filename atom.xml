Their style and presentation were not the only reason that made people look forward to buying an iPhone. Apple created its own operating system and presented their own versions of security and protection. One of the most recognized and impeccable features offered by Apple in its innovative structure was the security and safety through Apple ID and Apple Account. Every important feature that operated throughout the Apple iPhone XR or iPad was focused over a single entity, the Apple ID. However, apart from the Apple ID, there were several other layers of authentications and verifications that were added throughout the protocol structure. A couple of them are renowned as Two Factor Verification and Two Factor Authentication. This article produces a very generous set of advice that should be looked over while handing these layers of protection. To get a better understanding of the procedures involved, you need to look over the guide to gain better knowledge on how to turn off Two Factor Authentication on your Apple.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2020/11/two-factor-authentication-apple.jpg"                      alt="two factor authentication apple"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-Is-two-step-verification-the-same-as-two-factor-authentication"><a href="#Part-1-Is-two-step-verification-the-same-as-two-factor-authentication" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. Is two-step verification the same as two-factor authentication?"></a>Part 1. Is two-step verification the same as two-factor authentication?</h2><p>There might be a few differences involved in these two security models; however, it should be kept in mind that they focus their purpose on securing the Apple ID of the user. Two Factor Verification is a security protocol that protects access to the various activities performed through the Apple ID. It attenuates an extra verification step across the Apple iPhone XR device in addition to the password for the Apple ID. The device receives a verification code from an authentication factor that allows the authorities to confirm the credibility of the user.</p><p>The Two Factor Authentication is considered as an upgrade to the Two Factor Verification, which was released two years after the Two Factor Verification, in 2015. This authentication method exempted the offline recovery keys and application-specific passcodes. They added a six-digit authentication code onto the original password and produced an offline, time-dependent code that is to be generated through the Settings of the trusted device of the user. This feature was appended into the iOS 9 and OS X El Capitan with a region-specific target.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-turn-off-two-step-verification"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-turn-off-two-step-verification" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. How to turn off two-step verification?"></a>Part 2. How to turn off two-step verification?</h2><p>As you are aware of the Two-Step Verification process, it is quite easy and typical in configuring. However, when it comes to turning the settings off, it is also a simple and straightforward procedure that can be easily covered by following the steps provided below.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> You are required to open the Apple ID Account web page on your browser and sign in with your Apple ID credentials.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> As you log into the website, access the “Security” section, and tap “Edit” from the options provided on the list.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Tap on the “Two-Step Verification” option and turn it off. Confirm to conclude the process. You may be required to select the new security questions and verify the data of birth in the process. As you would be done with it, an email would be received across your connected address for confirmation.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-turn-off-two-factor-authentication-lower-than-iOS-10-3"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-turn-off-two-factor-authentication-lower-than-iOS-10-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 3. How to turn off two-factor authentication? (lower than iOS 10.3)"></a>Part 3. How to turn off two-factor authentication? (lower than iOS 10.3)</h2><p>Two Factor Authentication cannot be turned off in a few cases and accounts for iOS versions greater than 10.3. However, if you have activated Two Factor Authentication across the iOS versions lower than 10.3, you can deactivate the feature through a series of simple steps. The exemption of this security feature across your device leaves it protected only through a password and a few security questions. For turning off the Two Factor Authentication from your Apple device, you need to follow the steps provided as follows:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open your browser and access your Apple ID Account website. Provide the details of your Apple ID and log in.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Tap on “Edit” in the “Security” section and turn off the “Two Factor Authentication” option.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> This would lead you to set new security questions for the Apple ID account, followed by a verification of your date of birth. The successful execution of the process would lead to turning it off.</p><h2 id="Part-4-Why-can’t-you-turn-off-two-factor-authentication-if-you-already-use-it-iOS-10-3-and-later"><a href="#Part-4-Why-can’t-you-turn-off-two-factor-authentication-if-you-already-use-it-iOS-10-3-and-later" class="headerlink" title="Part 4. Why can’t you turn off two-factor authentication if you already use it? (iOS 10.3 and later)"></a>Part 4. Why can’t you turn off two-factor authentication if you already use it? (iOS 10.3 and later)</h2><p>For users who have an Apple device with an iOS 10.3 or later version, they cannot turn the Two Factor Authentication off after it is accessed. The latest iOS and macOS included extra layers of security in their features, which led towards a better security foundation and protection of information. Users who have updated their account information can unenroll in two weeks after updating. For this, you are required to simply access the confirmation email that you have received and tap on the link to approach the previous security settings. Thus, it makes it far more than impossible for users to turn their Two Factor Authentication off if they consider it unnecessary for their device. This feature is something that would always remain intact with their device as an extra layer of security. Its absence does leave a chance of illegal access to the Apple iPhone XR device and an increased risk of a security breach. Since it is directly built across the Apple iPhone XR device and its settings, this makes it a very hard-to-approach characteristic.</p><h2 id="Part-5-How-to-turn-off-two-factor-authentication-by-removing-Apple-ID"><a href="#Part-5-How-to-turn-off-two-factor-authentication-by-removing-Apple-ID" class="headerlink" title="Part 5.

How to turn off two-factor authentication by removing Apple ID</h2><p>Users who are very reluctant to remove the two-factor authentication off their device can consider removing the Apple ID itself for fulfilling the purpose. However, when it comes to executing such tasks, the need for a third-party platform gets evident. Third-party platforms provided dedicated services in providing users with a unique platform of operation with an environment that suits their purpose perfectly. Many platforms provide such impressive services, yet the selection gets quite difficult for a series of reasons.

Once the platform is done with the process, it provides a prompt message in the next window displaying the execution of the removal of Apple ID from your device. This also removes the Two Factor Authentication off your device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/remove-apple-id-8.png"                      alt="complete"                ></p><h2 id="Conclusion-1"><a href="#Conclusion-1" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>The article has presented a very detailed comparison of the Two Factor Verification and Two Factor Authentication and provided an elaborated discussion over how to turn these security features off their devices.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="How-to-Fix-Locked-Apple-ID-on-Apple-iPhone-15"><a href="#How-to-Fix-Locked-Apple-ID-on-Apple-iPhone-15" class="headerlink" title="How to Fix Locked Apple ID on Apple iPhone 15"></a>How to Fix Locked Apple ID on Apple iPhone 15</h2><p>Part of why you own and use Apple devices is the reliability of the Apple iPhone 15 devices and the ease of using them. This starts with the quality of hardware and the synergy with the software that runs the hardware, and the user experience you get. Apple puts great emphasis on this, and rightly so, for this is one of the keys defining and differentiating factors for people to choose Apple’s iOS over Google’s Android. Like with all good things in life, sometimes, a spanner is put in the works that bring your smooth-sailing life to an abrupt halt. With smartphones playing pivotal roles in our lives today, from payments to internet experiences to getting work done to stay in touch with people, anything that stops us from using our smartphone or endangers that experience is a cause for worry. A locked Apple ID is one such thing. It does not happen frequently, in fact, most users will never experience a locked Apple ID, but for the ones who are fortunate enough to have such a rare experience in life, help is at hand. All you need to do is relax and read on. By the end of it, you will have an unlocked Apple ID and you can go back to cruising.</p><h2 id="Part-I-Difference-Between-Activation-Lock-and-Locked-Apple-ID"><a href="#Part-I-Difference-Between-Activation-Lock-and-Locked-Apple-ID" class="headerlink" title="Part I: Difference Between Activation Lock and Locked Apple ID"></a>Part I: Difference Between Activation Lock and Locked Apple ID</h2><p>Apple being Apple, does a lot to make sure that users get the smoothest experience possible when interacting with their Apple products, both hardware, and software. Yet, sometimes, the messaging gets confusing, and people are not sure what is what. One such thing is the difference between iCloud Activation Lock and Apple ID Lock. While people are more likely to encounter Activation Lock and less likely to encounter Apple ID Lock, they are often confused when they encounter Apple ID Lock and struggle to figure out what that means and how to resolve the issue.</p><p>Activation Lock is when your supported Apple device is locked for a number of reasons. The most common reason is a stolen device that was locked by its owner, however, there are other perfectly valid reasons such as an outgoing employee forgetting to sign out and erase their Apple device before submitting it back. The IT department would not be able to reset that device without turning off Find My Apple iPhone 15 and Activation Lock on the Apple iPhone 15 device.</p><p>A locked Apple ID usually happens when the user has forgotten their password to their Apple ID account and attempts to figure out the password have been unsuccessful. Sometimes, Apple ID gets locked automatically under some conditions, and that requires users to reset their password to gain access. A locked Apple ID does not mean that your device is locked for your use. You can keep using it so long as you do not try to use another Apple ID with it since to do that you would have to sign out of your current Apple ID (which is locked) and you won’t be able to do that. On the other hand, Activation Lock renders the entire device unusable till the lock is cleared.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/10/unlock-apple-id-on-iphone-13-3.jpg"                      alt="apple id locked message"                ></p><p>In short, Apple ID Lock is about a user’s account with Apple, akin to how Google Account works on Android devices. Apple ID Lock locks a user’s account with Apple while retaining complete usage of the Apple iPhone 15 device whereas Activation Lock locks the Apple iPhone 15 device and prevents anyone from using it until the correct credentials are entered. This is about verifying the ownership of the Apple iPhone 15 device and works to deter theft of Apple devices.</p><h2 id="Part-II-Checking-If-Your-Apple-ID-Is-Locked"><a href="#Part-II-Checking-If-Your-Apple-ID-Is-Locked" class="headerlink" title="Part II: Checking If Your Apple ID Is Locked"></a>Part II: Checking If Your Apple ID Is Locked</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/10/unlock-apple-id-on-iphone-13-4.jpg"                      alt="the message of apple id locked"                ></p><p>A locked Apple ID is rather unmistakable. Your device would keep telling you that your Apple ID is locked for your security. Your Apple ID could be locked or disabled altogether if someone has tried to gain access to your account (and, obviously, failed). Apple would disable access to the Apple ID unless you are able to prove rightful ownership and reset the password successfully.</p><h2 id="Part-III-Reasons-for-Locked-Apple-ID"><a href="#Part-III-Reasons-for-Locked-Apple-ID" class="headerlink" title="Part III: Reasons for Locked Apple ID"></a>Part III: Reasons for Locked Apple ID</h2><p>There can be a few reasons why your Apple ID is locked. You forgot the password and now it is locked since you entered the wrong password too many times. A scarier prospect, albeit a real one, is that some malicious actor attempted to login into your Apple ID account but failed. Had they succeeded, you would have gotten a message that ‘your Apple ID is being used on another device’ now.</p><p>Apple does a lot to ensure that your Apple ID remains safe. You trust Apple with a lot of your data, including financial data by way of your credit cards associated with Apple ID to make purchases on the App Store and iTunes Store. Therefore, some of the time, Apple preempts issues by proactively locking up your Apple ID or even disabling it. It goes without saying that sometimes it is something so simple as a software error that is believed to have locked up Apple IDs for many users around the world a while ago. It is also entirely possible that it was some malicious actor probing the servers for accounts.</p><p>All of these will result in a locked Apple ID that users will have to reset their password to in order to gain access back.</p><h2 id="Part-IV-How-to-Unlock-Apple-ID-on-Apple-iPhone-15"><a href="#Part-IV-How-to-Unlock-Apple-ID-on-Apple-iPhone-15" class="headerlink" title="Part IV: How to Unlock Apple ID on Apple iPhone 15"></a>Part IV: How to Unlock Apple ID on Apple iPhone 15</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/10/unlock-apple-id-on-iphone-13-1.jpg"                      alt="apple id webpage"                ></p><p>It is unfortunate you are facing a locked Apple ID. Apple tries its best to make users aware of safety protocols they need to follow to minimize and mitigate such unfortunate occurrences, such as using two-factor authentication, trusted devices, trusted phone numbers, passwords, passcodes, etc. that serve as deterrents to prevent unauthorized access to devices and accounts. Yet, when the unfortunate happens, what to do?</p><h3 id="IV-I-Unlock-Apple-ID-Via-Two-Factor-Authentication"><a href="#IV-I-Unlock-Apple-ID-Via-Two-Factor-Authentication" class="headerlink" title="IV.I: Unlock Apple ID Via Two-Factor Authentication"></a>IV.I: Unlock Apple ID Via Two-Factor Authentication</h3><p>Apple implemented two-factor authentication a long time ago to prevent unauthorized access to Apple ID accounts. If you have it enabled, you would be able to use two-factor authentication to unlock your Apple ID again.</p><p>Step 1: Go to <strong><a class="link"   href="https://iforgot.apple.com/" >https://iforgot.apple.com <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/10/unlock-apple-id-on-iphone-13-5.jpg"                      alt="apple id iforgot support page"                ></p><p>Step 2: Key in your Apple ID and proceed.</p><p>Step 3: Confirm your mobile number associated with the Apple ID.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/10/unlock-apple-id-on-iphone-13-6.jpg"                      alt="apple id iforgot support"                ></p><p>If you have another device associated with the Apple ID and it is a trusted device, you can now receive instructions to proceed with a two-factor code on that device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/10/unlock-apple-id-on-iphone-13-7.jpg"                      alt="using iforgot support page to unlock"                ></p><p>Step 4: Use that code to unlock your Apple ID using two-factor authentication.</p><h3 id="IV-II-Unlock-Apple-ID-Via-Dr-Fone-Screen-Unlock-iOS"><a href="#IV-II-Unlock-Apple-ID-Via-Dr-Fone-Screen-Unlock-iOS" class="headerlink" title="IV.II Unlock Apple ID Via Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS)"></a>IV.II Unlock Apple ID Via Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS)</h3><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/drfone-toolkit/" >Dr.Fone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a name that will be instantly familiar to anyone who has ever had any issue with their mobile devices and would be able to vouch for the quality and efficacy of this software at fixing issues quickly and efficiently.</p><p>Dr.Fone is a collection of carefully crafted modules that helps you when most needed.

You must know the passcode of your device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/drfone/trust-computer.jpg"                      alt="trust this computer"                ></p><p>You will be asked on your Apple iPhone 15 to Trust the computer, and then you will need to enter the passcode.</p><p>Step 5: Unlocking Apple ID via Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS) will erase the contents of the Apple iPhone 15 device.

We use our Apple ID for iCloud services on Apple devices, to make purchases on iTunes Store and App Store and payments using Apple Pay. Apple knows this and has checked in place to make sure that only you are in possession of your Apple ID account at all times. It can cause a little hassle at times, since if someone makes multiple failed attempts to gain access to your account, Apple will lock your Apple ID until you can unlock it with proper verifications and reset your password.</p><h2 id="Protecting-Your-Privacy-How-To-Remove-Apple-ID-From-Apple-iPhone-15"><a href="#Protecting-Your-Privacy-How-To-Remove-Apple-ID-From-Apple-iPhone-15" class="headerlink" title="Protecting Your Privacy: How To Remove Apple ID From Apple iPhone 15"></a>Protecting Your Privacy: How To Remove Apple ID From Apple iPhone 15</h2><p>Protecting your privacy is crucial in today’s digital age.

However, after enabling the function, many iPhone users forget to remove it from the FindMy app ahead of time. Therefore, if you are selling or resetting the Apple iPhone SE device, you need to <strong>remove AirTag from Apple ID</strong> to be usable later.</p><p>If someone removes the AirTag without resetting it while operating in the Bluetooth range, deleting AirTag ownership will require manually breaking the Apple iPhone SE device apart and further configuration.</p><p>Remove this connection from the Apple ID account with simple steps first-hand to avoid that.

The AirTag feature is available for iOS devices. Therefore, one can register the AirTag process with the Apple ID you are utilizing on your smartphone.</p><p>Apple users can attach the AirTag to different objects like backpacks or keychains. This makes it simple to find these objects later in case they get misplaced or lost through the Find My app on the iPhone.</p><p>Users can add their AirTag to one Apple ID account, so you cannot access this from the Find My app via other accounts.

Why is the Apple account disabled?"></a>Part 1. Why is the Apple account disabled?</h2><p>Apple iPhone, iPad, and other devices operate over a single Operating System, with its own protocols and unique mechanisms that distinguish it from other smartphone models in the market. Apple believes in securing the data and identification of its users with its state-of-the-art security measures. Under such circumstances, it usually gets possible for the user to have his Apple account disabled unnecessarily. Whenever you encounter such a situation, there are several messages that might be displayed on your device to prompt you over the disabling of the account. These messages usually appear in situations where you intend to sign in to some platform with your associated Apple ID. The most common messages that appear on the screen are:</p><ul><li>“This Apple ID has been disabled for security reasons.”</li><li>“You can’t sign in because your account was disabled for security reasons.”</li><li>“This Apple ID has been locked for security reasons.”</li></ul><p>The messages that have been stated above are usually depicting a security anomaly that led to the disabling of the associated Apple ID. However, there can be several reasons that would have led to such circumstances, which are described as follows.</p><ul><li>There might be incorrect forced logging in into your Apple ID for multiple tries.</li><li>Any user would have entered incorrect security questions multiple times.</li><li>The other information associated with the Apple ID would have been entered incorrectly numerous times.</li></ul><h2 id="Part-2-Is-“Your-account-has-been-disabled-in-the-App-Store-and-iTunes”-the-same-as-“This-Apple-ID-has-been-disabled-for-security-reasons”"><a href="#Part-2-Is-“Your-account-has-been-disabled-in-the-App-Store-and-iTunes”-the-same-as-“This-Apple-ID-has-been-disabled-for-security-reasons”" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

Is “Your account has been disabled in the App Store and iTunes” the same as “This Apple ID has been disabled for security reasons”?</h2><p>There are several instances where you encounter such prompt messages where you are restricted in using the App Store and iTunes. These messages can come in the form of “Your account has been disabled in the App Store and iTunes.” Over observing this prompt message, it has been discovered that the assorted message is not related to the other common message of “This Apple ID has been disabled for security reasons.” The dynamics of getting restricted from using the App Store and iTunes are related to remaining balances that have stuck around for a while over your Apple account.

This problem can be countered through simplistic methods under such conditions where you are having access to the account information and can check for the basic billing information or update the payment method following other settings that are associated with paying bills. Over failure in accessing your account, you are required to contact Apple Support and look for the billing and payment statements to clear up all the remaining dues. Apple has considered covering all the security protocols to perfection, where you have any prevailing Apple charges on your connected credit card that would lead to direct disabling of your Apple Account.</p><p>Even though Apple accounts can be generally disabled overpayment issues, there are several security reasons that might restrict you in discovering and buying different products across the App Store and iTunes.

Due to this, they have added multiple security features, including two-factor authentication. Thus, if you create an Apple ID, you can see a two-factor authentication option that adds an extra layer of security.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/10/remove-two-factor-authentication-1.jpg"                      alt="what is two factor authentication"                ></p><p>2FA is activated when the user provides the password to log into the Apple ID or software through a new device, and it acts as a second layer for account security. Apple ID or any software containing sensitive data cannot be accessed without it. This method provides a higher security level than single-factor authentication. To understand more benefits of this security system in detail, check the following points:</p><ol><li><strong>Protection From Password Theft:</strong> 2FA acts as an additional security level. It protects your accounts and devices in case your password is leaked.</li><li><strong>Migrations of Unauthorized Assets:</strong> Online banking applications use 2FA to protect users from unauthorized bank transfers. If someone accesses their app, this is a beneficial security measure.</li><li><strong>Protection on Multiple Services:</strong> Platforms, including social media, banks, and cloud storage, use 2FA. It means that 2FA can be used in various digital aspects.</li></ol><h2 id="Part-2-Can-You-Remove-the-Two-Factor-Authentication-iCloud-at-Anytime"><a href="#Part-2-Can-You-Remove-the-Two-Factor-Authentication-iCloud-at-Anytime" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Can You Remove the Two Factor Authentication iCloud at Anytime"></a>Part 2: Can You Remove the Two Factor Authentication iCloud at Anytime</h2><p>Many people use 2FA globally to protect their personal information and devices from hackers and unauthorized access. However, in some cases, users may want to <strong>remove two-factor authentication iCloud</strong> for multiple reasons. This includes scenarios in which their device is lost or damaged or if they have found a better security option than this one.</p><p>Moreover, there is one important key point to note: Apple has removed the feature of deactivating 2FA from the Apple ID. It means you need to think twice before activating this feature on your Apple ID because it cannot be reversed. For the following reasons, Apple has taken this initiative:</p><ol><li><strong>Enhanced Security:</strong> By removing the deactivation option for 2FA, Apple is trying to strengthen its account security to ensure that no one can access its user’s data.</li><li><strong>Reducing Vulnerabilities:</strong> Allowing users to deactivate 2FA could cause vulnerabilities in the Apple ecosystem that can be a weak point for protecting users’ data. That is why Apple has removed the deactivation option to stop malicious actors from taking advantage of this vulnerability.</li><li><strong>Encouraging Security Awareness:</strong> To make Apple users more security conscious, Apple has made it difficult on purpose to remove 2FA. It helps users to be more confident in Apple services and products.</li><li><strong>Minimizing Mistakenly Steps:</strong> If users mistakenly remove the 2FA, their accounts and devices are at risk of being accessed without proper authentication. To avoid such an issue, the deactivation option of 2FA is removed.</li></ol><p>Besides all these reasons, there is still some good news for those who want to <strong>remove the two-factor authentication iPhone</strong> to use other security options. The good news is that Apple allows users to remove 2FA for a limited time after activation.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-To-Remove-the-Two-Factor-Authentication-Within-14-Days"><a href="#Part-3-How-To-Remove-the-Two-Factor-Authentication-Within-14-Days" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How To Remove the Two-Factor Authentication Within 14 Days"></a>Part 3: How To Remove the Two-Factor Authentication Within 14 Days</h2><p>As explained in the last part, Apple has made removing the 2FA option from Apple ID challenging for several security reasons. Thus, if you want to remove 2FA from your Apple ID, you have only 14 days after activating this feature. To understand <strong>how to disable iCloud two-factor authentication</strong> within this given time, check the following steps:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1.</strong> Once you have activated the 2FA feature, your 14-day grace period will start eventually. To deactivate this, open the enrollment email you received from Apple regarding 2FA on your Apple ID.</li><li><strong>Step 2.</strong> Scroll to the bottom of this email and select the link or button to return to your account security &amp; settings section.

Following are the straightforward instructions to unlock Apple ID with Wondershare Dr.Fone:</p><ul><li>Step 1: Choose the Remove Apple ID Tool</li></ul><p>Begin the process by installing Wondershare Dr.Fone on your computer and accessing its main interface. After this, tap on the “Toolbox” from the left side toolbar and choose the “Screen Unlock” option. This will take you to a new window where you need to select “iOS” as your device’s nature. From the new window, tap on the “Remove Apple ID” to proceed with the Apple ID unlocking process.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/remove-apple-id-1.png"                      alt="select remove apple id tool"                ></p><ul><li>Step 2: Proceed Further by Choosing the Respective Options</li></ul><p>Ensure that your iOS device whose lock you are trying to remove is connected to your computer and tap “Unlock Now.” Moving ahead, the platform will ask you whether screen lock and 2FA are enabled. This needs to be enabled for the Apple ID removal process. After this, put your device in Recovery Mode with the help of on-screen instructions.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/remove-apple-id-5.png"                      alt="activate the recovery mode"                ></p><ul><li>Step 3: Select the iOS Firmware Version</li></ul><p>Once the platform detects your device model, choose your system version and then click the “Start” button. The respective iOS firmware will start downloading, and Wondershare Dr.Fone will verify it once it is downloaded. Following this, click “Unlock Now,” which will lead to a warning popup.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/unlock-ios-screen-6.png"                      alt="click on unlock now button"                ></p><ul><li>Step 4: Conclude the Process To Unlock Your Apple ID</li></ul><p>The warning informs you about the imminent data loss that will result during Apple ID unlocking.

Here enter any random number and click “Done”.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2020/05/enter-random-password.jpg"                      alt="enter random password"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> iCloud will tell you the password is incorrect. Tap “Ok” and you’ll be prompted back to the iCloud screen.</p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Now, click on “Account” and erase everything from “Description”. Click “Done” and you’ll again go back to the iCloud screen.

Let’s walk you through the process of deleting an iCloud account using iTunes.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> First of all, make sure to disable the “Find My iPhone” feature. Navigate to “Settings” &gt; “iCloud” &gt; “Find My iPhone” and toggle the switch off to turn off the feature.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2020/05/disable-find-my-iphone.jpg"                      alt="disable find my iphone"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Now, go back to the “Settings” window and click “iTunes &amp; App Store”.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2020/05/itunes-and-app-store.jpg"                      alt="itunes and app store"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Tap on your “Account” at the top. A pop-up will appear on your screen. Here, click “Sign Out” and the iCloud account will be removed from your iDevice.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2020/05/apple-id-itunes.jpg"                      alt="apple id itunes"                ></p><h3 id="1-3-Create-a-new-password"><a href="#1-3-Create-a-new-password" class="headerlink" title="1.3 Create a new password"></a>1.3 Create a new password</h3><p>If you have enabled two-way verification on your Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max, you can also delete the iCloud account by resetting the password. In this case, however, you’ll have to visit the <a class="link"   href="https://appleid.apple.com/" >Apple ID Account Page <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and use it to reset the password.</p><p>Here’s how to delete iCloud account without password by creating a new password.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Visit the Apple ID Account page and select “Forgot Apple ID or Password”.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2020/05/forgot-apple-id-or-password.jpg"                      alt="forgot apple id or password"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Now, enter your Apple ID and tap “Continue”. Select “I Need to Reset My Password” to initiate the password resetting process.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> You’ll be prompted to a new window where you’ll have to enter the “Recover Key”. This key is an exclusive that’s generated when a user enables two-way verification for their iCloud account.</p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Enter the recovery key and tap “Continue”. Now, select a trusted device where you want to receive the verification code. Enter this verification code to continue with the process.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2020/05/enter-recovery-key.jpg"                      alt="enter recovery key"                ></p><p><strong>Step 5:</strong> In the next window, you can reset the password. Simply, add the new password and click the “Reset Password” button.</p><p>Once the password is changed, you can easily delete your iCloud account by going to “Settings” &gt; “iCloud” &gt; “Delete Account”. Enter the new password and your iCloud account will be deleted permanently.</p><p>In case you haven’t enabled two-way verification for your iCloud account, there’s still a way to reset the password. However, you must remember the security questions that you answered or the recovery e-mail you had added while setting up your iCloud account.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open the Apple ID Account page and tap “Forgot Apple ID or Password”. Enter your Apple ID and select “I need to reset my password”.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> You’ll be redirected to a new window displaying two different methods, i.e., “Answer Security Questions” an “Get an Email.” Choose a suitable method and follow the further steps to reset your password.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2020/05/recovery-email.jpg"                      alt="recovery email"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-delete-iCloud-account-without-password-on-computer-using-Dr-Fone-Screen-Unlock-iOS"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-delete-iCloud-account-without-password-on-computer-using-Dr-Fone-Screen-Unlock-iOS" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to delete iCloud account without password on computer using Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS)?"></a>Part 2: How to delete iCloud account without password on computer using Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS)?</h2><p>If you find all the above methods slightly challenging, we have a simpler solution for you. <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/iphone-unlock/" >Wondershare Dr.Fone Screen Unlock (iOS) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is an exclusive tool for iOS users that’ll help them remove screen locks and delete iCloud accounts from an iDevice, even if you don’t remember the password or even if the “Find My iPhone” feature is enabled.</p><p>Thanks to its user-friendly interface, it’ll become a hassle-free task to delete the iCloud account using Dr.Fone Screen Unlock.

Due to this, they have added multiple security features, including two-factor authentication. Thus, if you create an Apple ID, you can see a two-factor authentication option that adds an extra layer of security.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/10/remove-two-factor-authentication-1.jpg"                      alt="what is two factor authentication"                ></p><p>2FA is activated when the user provides the password to log into the Apple ID or software through a new device, and it acts as a second layer for account security. Apple ID or any software containing sensitive data cannot be accessed without it. This method provides a higher security level than single-factor authentication. To understand more benefits of this security system in detail, check the following points:</p><ol><li><strong>Protection From Password Theft:</strong> 2FA acts as an additional security level. It protects your accounts and devices in case your password is leaked.</li><li><strong>Migrations of Unauthorized Assets:</strong> Online banking applications use 2FA to protect users from unauthorized bank transfers. If someone accesses their app, this is a beneficial security measure.</li><li><strong>Protection on Multiple Services:</strong> Platforms, including social media, banks, and cloud storage, use 2FA. It means that 2FA can be used in various digital aspects.</li></ol><h2 id="Part-2-Can-You-Remove-the-Two-Factor-Authentication-iCloud-at-Anytime"><a href="#Part-2-Can-You-Remove-the-Two-Factor-Authentication-iCloud-at-Anytime" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Can You Remove the Two Factor Authentication iCloud at Anytime"></a>Part 2: Can You Remove the Two Factor Authentication iCloud at Anytime</h2><p>Many people use 2FA globally to protect their personal information and devices from hackers and unauthorized access. However, in some cases, users may want to <strong>remove two-factor authentication iCloud</strong> for multiple reasons. This includes scenarios in which their device is lost or damaged or if they have found a better security option than this one.</p><p>Moreover, there is one important key point to note: Apple has removed the feature of deactivating 2FA from the Apple ID. It means you need to think twice before activating this feature on your Apple ID because it cannot be reversed. For the following reasons, Apple has taken this initiative:</p><ol><li><strong>Enhanced Security:</strong> By removing the deactivation option for 2FA, Apple is trying to strengthen its account security to ensure that no one can access its user’s data.</li><li><strong>Reducing Vulnerabilities:</strong> Allowing users to deactivate 2FA could cause vulnerabilities in the Apple ecosystem that can be a weak point for protecting users’ data. That is why Apple has removed the deactivation option to stop malicious actors from taking advantage of this vulnerability.</li><li><strong>Encouraging Security Awareness:</strong> To make Apple users more security conscious, Apple has made it difficult on purpose to remove 2FA. It helps users to be more confident in Apple services and products.</li><li><strong>Minimizing Mistakenly Steps:</strong> If users mistakenly remove the 2FA, their accounts and devices are at risk of being accessed without proper authentication. To avoid such an issue, the deactivation option of 2FA is removed.</li></ol><p>Besides all these reasons, there is still some good news for those who want to <strong>remove the two-factor authentication iPhone</strong> to use other security options. The good news is that Apple allows users to remove 2FA for a limited time after activation.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-To-Remove-the-Two-Factor-Authentication-Within-14-Days"><a href="#Part-3-How-To-Remove-the-Two-Factor-Authentication-Within-14-Days" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How To Remove the Two-Factor Authentication Within 14 Days"></a>Part 3: How To Remove the Two-Factor Authentication Within 14 Days</h2><p>As explained in the last part, Apple has made removing the 2FA option from Apple ID challenging for several security reasons. Thus, if you want to remove 2FA from your Apple ID, you have only 14 days after activating this feature. To understand <strong>how to disable iCloud two-factor authentication</strong> within this given time, check the following steps:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1.</strong> Once you have activated the 2FA feature, your 14-day grace period will start eventually. To deactivate this, open the enrollment email you received from Apple regarding 2FA on your Apple ID.</li><li><strong>Step 2.</strong> Scroll to the bottom of this email and select the link or button to return to your account security &amp; settings section.
