This starts with the quality of hardware and the synergy with the software that runs the hardware, and the user experience you get. Apple puts great emphasis on this, and rightly so, for this is one of the keys defining and differentiating factors for people to choose Apple’s iOS over Google’s Android. Like with all good things in life, sometimes, a spanner is put in the works that bring your smooth-sailing life to an abrupt halt. With smartphones playing pivotal roles in our lives today, from payments to internet experiences to getting work done to stay in touch with people, anything that stops us from using our smartphone or endangers that experience is a cause for worry. A locked Apple ID is one such thing. It does not happen frequently, in fact, most users will never experience a locked Apple ID, but for the ones who are fortunate enough to have such a rare experience in life, help is at hand. All you need to do is relax and read on. By the end of it, you will have an unlocked Apple ID and you can go back to cruising.</p><h2 id="Part-I-Difference-Between-Activation-Lock-and-Locked-Apple-ID"><a href="#Part-I-Difference-Between-Activation-Lock-and-Locked-Apple-ID" class="headerlink" title="Part I: Difference Between Activation Lock and Locked Apple ID"></a>Part I: Difference Between Activation Lock and Locked Apple ID</h2><p>Apple being Apple, does a lot to make sure that users get the smoothest experience possible when interacting with their Apple products, both hardware, and software. Yet, sometimes, the messaging gets confusing, and people are not sure what is what. One such thing is the difference between iCloud Activation Lock and Apple ID Lock. While people are more likely to encounter Activation Lock and less likely to encounter Apple ID Lock, they are often confused when they encounter Apple ID Lock and struggle to figure out what that means and how to resolve the issue.</p><p>Activation Lock is when your supported Apple device is locked for a number of reasons. The most common reason is a stolen device that was locked by its owner, however, there are other perfectly valid reasons such as an outgoing employee forgetting to sign out and erase their Apple device before submitting it back. The IT department would not be able to reset that device without turning off Find My Apple iPhone 14 Plus and Activation Lock on the Apple iPhone 14 Plus device.</p><p>A locked Apple ID usually happens when the user has forgotten their password to their Apple ID account and attempts to figure out the password have been unsuccessful. Sometimes, Apple ID gets locked automatically under some conditions, and that requires users to reset their password to gain access. A locked Apple ID does not mean that your device is locked for your use. You can keep using it so long as you do not try to use another Apple ID with it since to do that you would have to sign out of your current Apple ID (which is locked) and you won’t be able to do that. On the other hand, Activation Lock renders the entire device unusable till the lock is cleared.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/10/unlock-apple-id-on-iphone-13-3.jpg"                      alt="apple id locked message"                ></p><p>In short, Apple ID Lock is about a user’s account with Apple, akin to how Google Account works on Android devices. Apple ID Lock locks a user’s account with Apple while retaining complete usage of the Apple iPhone 14 Plus device whereas Activation Lock locks the Apple iPhone 14 Plus device and prevents anyone from using it until the correct credentials are entered. This is about verifying the ownership of the Apple iPhone 14 Plus device and works to deter theft of Apple devices.</p><h2 id="Part-II-Checking-If-Your-Apple-ID-Is-Locked"><a href="#Part-II-Checking-If-Your-Apple-ID-Is-Locked" class="headerlink" title="Part II: Checking If Your Apple ID Is Locked"></a>Part II: Checking If Your Apple ID Is Locked</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/10/unlock-apple-id-on-iphone-13-4.jpg"                      alt="the message of apple id locked"                ></p><p>A locked Apple ID is rather unmistakable. Your device would keep telling you that your Apple ID is locked for your security. Your Apple ID could be locked or disabled altogether if someone has tried to gain access to your account (and, obviously, failed). Apple would disable access to the Apple ID unless you are able to prove rightful ownership and reset the password successfully.</p><h2 id="Part-III-Reasons-for-Locked-Apple-ID"><a href="#Part-III-Reasons-for-Locked-Apple-ID" class="headerlink" title="Part III: Reasons for Locked Apple ID"></a>Part III: Reasons for Locked Apple ID</h2><p>There can be a few reasons why your Apple ID is locked. You forgot the password and now it is locked since you entered the wrong password too many times. A scarier prospect, albeit a real one, is that some malicious actor attempted to login into your Apple ID account but failed. Had they succeeded, you would have gotten a message that ‘your Apple ID is being used on another device’ now.</p><p>Apple does a lot to ensure that your Apple ID remains safe. You trust Apple with a lot of your data, including financial data by way of your credit cards associated with Apple ID to make purchases on the App Store and iTunes Store. Therefore, some of the time, Apple preempts issues by proactively locking up your Apple ID or even disabling it. It goes without saying that sometimes it is something so simple as a software error that is believed to have locked up Apple IDs for many users around the world a while ago. It is also entirely possible that it was some malicious actor probing the servers for accounts.</p><p>All of these will result in a locked Apple ID that users will have to reset their password to in order to gain access back.</p><h2 id="Part-IV-How-to-Unlock-Apple-ID-on-Apple-iPhone-14-Plus"><a href="#Part-IV-How-to-Unlock-Apple-ID-on-Apple-iPhone-14-Plus" class="headerlink" title="Part IV: How to Unlock Apple ID on Apple iPhone 14 Plus"></a>Part IV: How to Unlock Apple ID on Apple iPhone 14 Plus</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/10/unlock-apple-id-on-iphone-13-1.jpg"                      alt="apple id webpage"                ></p><p>It is unfortunate you are facing a locked Apple ID. Apple tries its best to make users aware of safety protocols they need to follow to minimize and mitigate such unfortunate occurrences, such as using two-factor authentication, trusted devices, trusted phone numbers, passwords, passcodes, etc. that serve as deterrents to prevent unauthorized access to devices and accounts.

Have it handy to avoid any delays. It’s necessary for security verification during the erasure process.</p><p>Unpair Apple Watch</p><p>If you own an Apple Watch, unpair it from your Apple iPhone 14 Plus.

How to Fix"></a>Why Apple Account Disabled On your Apple iPhone 14 Plus? How to Fix</h2><p>Apple is one of the leading smartphone developing enterprises that has introduced the world to a contemporary set of features that are not common among other leading smartphone companies. One of the major distinguishing characteristics of Apple has been displayed in its present security protocols. Apple Account is regarded as one of the most significant credentials of the Apple iPhone 14 Plus and iPad that is responsible for connecting and holding the applications and the assorted data. Many users have generally reported unusual situations that got their Apple Account disabled. There are several reasons that can be associated with the Apple account getting disabled. The major repercussion that is associated with it is unnecessary data loss following the suspension of all products that have been bought with the account over time. This article provides you an impressive overview of the major reasons that lead to your Apple Account getting disabled, followed by the associated mechanisms that can be tested to secure the account.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Why-is-the-Apple-account-disabled"><a href="#Part-1-Why-is-the-Apple-account-disabled" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. Why is the Apple account disabled?"></a>Part 1. Why is the Apple account disabled?</h2><p>Apple iPhone, iPad, and other devices operate over a single Operating System, with its own protocols and unique mechanisms that distinguish it from other smartphone models in the market. Apple believes in securing the data and identification of its users with its state-of-the-art security measures. Under such circumstances, it usually gets possible for the user to have his Apple account disabled unnecessarily. Whenever you encounter such a situation, there are several messages that might be displayed on your device to prompt you over the disabling of the account. These messages usually appear in situations where you intend to sign in to some platform with your associated Apple ID. The most common messages that appear on the screen are:</p><ul><li>“This Apple ID has been disabled for security reasons.”</li><li>“You can’t sign in because your account was disabled for security reasons.”</li><li>“This Apple ID has been locked for security reasons.”</li></ul><p>The messages that have been stated above are usually depicting a security anomaly that led to the disabling of the associated Apple ID. However, there can be several reasons that would have led to such circumstances, which are described as follows.</p><ul><li>There might be incorrect forced logging in into your Apple ID for multiple tries.</li><li>Any user would have entered incorrect security questions multiple times.</li><li>The other information associated with the Apple ID would have been entered incorrectly numerous times.</li></ul><h2 id="Part-2-Is-“Your-account-has-been-disabled-in-the-App-Store-and-iTunes”-the-same-as-“This-Apple-ID-has-been-disabled-for-security-reasons”"><a href="#Part-2-Is-“Your-account-has-been-disabled-in-the-App-Store-and-iTunes”-the-same-as-“This-Apple-ID-has-been-disabled-for-security-reasons”" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. Is “Your account has been disabled in the App Store and iTunes” the same as “This Apple ID has been disabled for security reasons”?"></a>Part 2. Is “Your account has been disabled in the App Store and iTunes” the same as “This Apple ID has been disabled for security reasons”?</h2><p>There are several instances where you encounter such prompt messages where you are restricted in using the App Store and iTunes. These messages can come in the form of “Your account has been disabled in the App Store and iTunes.” Over observing this prompt message, it has been discovered that the assorted message is not related to the other common message of “This Apple ID has been disabled for security reasons.” The dynamics of getting restricted from using the App Store and iTunes are related to remaining balances that have stuck around for a while over your Apple account. Normally, you may have some billing issues that are prevailing over an unpaid iTunes or App Store order. This problem can be countered through simplistic methods under such conditions where you are having access to the account information and can check for the basic billing information or update the payment method following other settings that are associated with paying bills. Over failure in accessing your account, you are required to contact Apple Support and look for the billing and payment statements to clear up all the remaining dues. Apple has considered covering all the security protocols to perfection, where you have any prevailing Apple charges on your connected credit card that would lead to direct disabling of your Apple Account.</p><p>Even though Apple accounts can be generally disabled overpayment issues, there are several security reasons that might restrict you in discovering and buying different products across the App Store and iTunes. It is necessary for you, as an Apple user, to remain prompt of all the issues that are relating to your Apple Account.</p><h2 id="Part-3-2-tips-to-Unlock-Disabled-Apple-Account"><a href="#Part-3-2-tips-to-Unlock-Disabled-Apple-Account" class="headerlink" title="Part 3. 2 tips to Unlock Disabled Apple Account"></a>Part 3. 2 tips to Unlock Disabled Apple Account</h2><p>As this article provides you a detailed overview of the reasons that lead to your Apple Account getting disabled, this article also considers providing you a few tips and tricks that would guide you in efficiently unlocking your Apple Account and use it with ease.</p><h3 id="Unlock-disabled-Apple-account-with-Dr-Fone"><a href="#Unlock-disabled-Apple-account-with-Dr-Fone" class="headerlink" title="Unlock disabled Apple account with Dr. Fone"></a>Unlock disabled Apple account with Dr. Fone</h3><p>The first remedy that can be effectively tested across such situations that involve disabled Apple accounts is relating a third-party platform.

If you had set it up for your account, you can use it if you forgot Apple ID password. Here’s how it works:</p><ol><li>Go to the URL <a class="link"   href="http://iforgot.apple.com/" >iforgot.apple.com <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</li><li>Click the “Enter your Apple ID” option and type in your Apple ID to launch the recovery process.</li><li>You should be prompted to enter your recovery key.

Enter this code as requested on the website and click “Next”.</li><li>After the verification is complete, you can now set up a new password and hopefully, you’ll remember it this time.</li></ol><p><strong>Note:</strong> Be wary of using recovery keys! Though they are a very secure and effective method of password recovery, you could easily get permanently locked out of your Apple account. When using a recovery key, you initially need:</p><ol><li>An Apple ID password.</li><li>A trusted device that you can easily access.</li><li>The actual Recovery Key.</li></ol><p>Now if you happen to lose any two of the above at the same time, there is no way of recovering your account and you simply have to create a new one.</p><p>Also Read: <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/reset-iphone/factory-reset-iphone-without-passcode.html" >How to Factory Reset iPhone without Passcode &gt;&gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="Part-7-Using-Apple’s-Two-Factor-Authentication-Forgot-Apple-ID-Password"><a href="#Part-7-Using-Apple’s-Two-Factor-Authentication-Forgot-Apple-ID-Password" class="headerlink" title="Part 7: Using Apple’s Two-Factor Authentication (Forgot Apple ID Password)"></a>Part 7: Using Apple’s Two-Factor Authentication (Forgot Apple ID Password)</h2><p>This is a new account recovery option that is built into iOS 9 and OS X El Capitan.

This starts with the quality of hardware and the synergy with the software that runs the hardware, and the user experience you get. Apple puts great emphasis on this, and rightly so, for this is one of the keys defining and differentiating factors for people to choose Apple’s iOS over Google’s Android. Like with all good things in life, sometimes, a spanner is put in the works that bring your smooth-sailing life to an abrupt halt. With smartphones playing pivotal roles in our lives today, from payments to internet experiences to getting work done to stay in touch with people, anything that stops us from using our smartphone or endangers that experience is a cause for worry. A locked Apple ID is one such thing. It does not happen frequently, in fact, most users will never experience a locked Apple ID, but for the ones who are fortunate enough to have such a rare experience in life, help is at hand. All you need to do is relax and read on. By the end of it, you will have an unlocked Apple ID and you can go back to cruising.</p><h2 id="Part-I-Difference-Between-Activation-Lock-and-Locked-Apple-ID"><a href="#Part-I-Difference-Between-Activation-Lock-and-Locked-Apple-ID" class="headerlink" title="Part I: Difference Between Activation Lock and Locked Apple ID"></a>Part I: Difference Between Activation Lock and Locked Apple ID</h2><p>Apple being Apple, does a lot to make sure that users get the smoothest experience possible when interacting with their Apple products, both hardware, and software. Yet, sometimes, the messaging gets confusing, and people are not sure what is what. One such thing is the difference between iCloud Activation Lock and Apple ID Lock. While people are more likely to encounter Activation Lock and less likely to encounter Apple ID Lock, they are often confused when they encounter Apple ID Lock and struggle to figure out what that means and how to resolve the issue.</p><p>Activation Lock is when your supported Apple device is locked for a number of reasons. The most common reason is a stolen device that was locked by its owner, however, there are other perfectly valid reasons such as an outgoing employee forgetting to sign out and erase their Apple device before submitting it back. The IT department would not be able to reset that device without turning off Find My Apple iPhone 14 Plus and Activation Lock on the Apple iPhone 14 Plus device.</p><p>A locked Apple ID usually happens when the user has forgotten their password to their Apple ID account and attempts to figure out the password have been unsuccessful. Sometimes, Apple ID gets locked automatically under some conditions, and that requires users to reset their password to gain access. A locked Apple ID does not mean that your device is locked for your use. You can keep using it so long as you do not try to use another Apple ID with it since to do that you would have to sign out of your current Apple ID (which is locked) and you won’t be able to do that. On the other hand, Activation Lock renders the entire device unusable till the lock is cleared.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://modlily.sjv.io/c/5597632/1997817/17059" target="_top" id="1997817"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17059-1997817"                      border="0" alt="" width="300" height="250"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1997817/17059"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/10/unlock-apple-id-on-iphone-13-3.jpg"                      alt="apple id locked message"                ></p><p>In short, Apple ID Lock is about a user’s account with Apple, akin to how Google Account works on Android devices. Apple ID Lock locks a user’s account with Apple while retaining complete usage of the Apple iPhone 14 Plus device whereas Activation Lock locks the Apple iPhone 14 Plus device and prevents anyone from using it until the correct credentials are entered.

A scarier prospect, albeit a real one, is that some malicious actor attempted to login into your Apple ID account but failed. Had they succeeded, you would have gotten a message that ‘your Apple ID is being used on another device’ now.</p><p>Apple does a lot to ensure that your Apple ID remains safe. You trust Apple with a lot of your data, including financial data by way of your credit cards associated with Apple ID to make purchases on the App Store and iTunes Store. Therefore, some of the time, Apple preempts issues by proactively locking up your Apple ID or even disabling it. It goes without saying that sometimes it is something so simple as a software error that is believed to have locked up Apple IDs for many users around the world a while ago. It is also entirely possible that it was some malicious actor probing the servers for accounts.</p><p>All of these will result in a locked Apple ID that users will have to reset their password to in order to gain access back.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://mindmanager.sjv.io/c/5597632/1787667/20231" target="_top" id="1787667"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/20231-1787667"                      border="0" alt="" width="728" height="90"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1787667/20231"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-IV-How-to-Unlock-Apple-ID-on-Apple-iPhone-14-Plus"><a href="#Part-IV-How-to-Unlock-Apple-ID-on-Apple-iPhone-14-Plus" class="headerlink" title="Part IV: How to Unlock Apple ID on Apple iPhone 14 Plus"></a>Part IV: How to Unlock Apple ID on Apple iPhone 14 Plus</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/10/unlock-apple-id-on-iphone-13-1.jpg"                      alt="apple id webpage"                ></p><p>It is unfortunate you are facing a locked Apple ID.

We use our Apple ID for iCloud services on Apple devices, to make purchases on iTunes Store and App Store and payments using Apple Pay. Apple knows this and has checked in place to make sure that only you are in possession of your Apple ID account at all times. It can cause a little hassle at times, since if someone makes multiple failed attempts to gain access to your account, Apple will lock your Apple ID until you can unlock it with proper verifications and reset your password.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins><br><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://fox-hovers.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-navigating-lut-use-in-professional-video-editing/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Navigating LUT Use in Professional Video Editing</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-access.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-personal-drones-that-perfectly-trace-their-owners-path/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  Personal Drones That Perfectly Trace Their Owner's Path</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/affordable-z-edge-z3-plus-dashcam-review-the-ultimate-choice-for-budget-friendly-safety/"><u>Affordable Z-Edge Z3 Plus Dashcam Review - The Ultimate Choice for Budget-Friendly Safety</u></a></li><li><a href="https://apple-account.techidaily.com/apple-id-locked-or-disabled-on-iphone-14-plus-7-mehtods-you-cant-miss-by-drfone-ios/"><u>Apple ID Locked or Disabled On iPhone 14 Plus? 7 Mehtods You Cant-Miss</u></a></li><li><a href="https://apple-account.techidaily.com/apple-id-unlock-from-apple-iphone-xs-how-to-fix-it-by-drfone-ios/"><u>Apple ID Unlock From Apple iPhone XS?

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="How-to-Fix-Locked-Apple-ID-on-Apple-iPhone-14-Plus"><a href="#How-to-Fix-Locked-Apple-ID-on-Apple-iPhone-14-Plus" class="headerlink" title="How to Fix Locked Apple ID on Apple iPhone 14 Plus"></a>How to Fix Locked Apple ID on Apple iPhone 14 Plus</h2><p>Part of why you own and use Apple devices is the reliability of the Apple iPhone 14 Plus devices and the ease of using them. This starts with the quality of hardware and the synergy with the software that runs the hardware, and the user experience you get. Apple puts great emphasis on this, and rightly so, for this is one of the keys defining and differentiating factors for people to choose Apple’s iOS over Google’s Android. Like with all good things in life, sometimes, a spanner is put in the works that bring your smooth-sailing life to an abrupt halt. With smartphones playing pivotal roles in our lives today, from payments to internet experiences to getting work done to stay in touch with people, anything that stops us from using our smartphone or endangers that experience is a cause for worry. A locked Apple ID is one such thing. It does not happen frequently, in fact, most users will never experience a locked Apple ID, but for the ones who are fortunate enough to have such a rare experience in life, help is at hand. All you need to do is relax and read on. By the end of it, you will have an unlocked Apple ID and you can go back to cruising.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mondly.com%3FAFFILIATE%3D108875%26RESOURCE%3D%2BEducational%2B300x600%2B"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/69c418c33ec2e1a4267fa9bb77fa1428/educational-300x600.gif"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-I-Difference-Between-Activation-Lock-and-Locked-Apple-ID"><a href="#Part-I-Difference-Between-Activation-Lock-and-Locked-Apple-ID" class="headerlink" title="Part I: Difference Between Activation Lock and Locked Apple ID"></a>Part I: Difference Between Activation Lock and Locked Apple ID</h2><p>Apple being Apple, does a lot to make sure that users get the smoothest experience possible when interacting with their Apple products, both hardware, and software. Yet, sometimes, the messaging gets confusing, and people are not sure what is what. One such thing is the difference between iCloud Activation Lock and Apple ID Lock. While people are more likely to encounter Activation Lock and less likely to encounter Apple ID Lock, they are often confused when they encounter Apple ID Lock and struggle to figure out what that means and how to resolve the issue.</p><p>Activation Lock is when your supported Apple device is locked for a number of reasons. The most common reason is a stolen device that was locked by its owner, however, there are other perfectly valid reasons such as an outgoing employee forgetting to sign out and erase their Apple device before submitting it back. The IT department would not be able to reset that device without turning off Find My Apple iPhone 14 Plus and Activation Lock on the Apple iPhone 14 Plus device.</p><p>A locked Apple ID usually happens when the user has forgotten their password to their Apple ID account and attempts to figure out the password have been unsuccessful. Sometimes, Apple ID gets locked automatically under some conditions, and that requires users to reset their password to gain access. A locked Apple ID does not mean that your device is locked for your use. You can keep using it so long as you do not try to use another Apple ID with it since to do that you would have to sign out of your current Apple ID (which is locked) and you won’t be able to do that. On the other hand, Activation Lock renders the entire device unusable till the lock is cleared.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/10/unlock-apple-id-on-iphone-13-3.jpg"                      alt="apple id locked message"                ></p><p>In short, Apple ID Lock is about a user’s account with Apple, akin to how Google Account works on Android devices. Apple ID Lock locks a user’s account with Apple while retaining complete usage of the Apple iPhone 14 Plus device whereas Activation Lock locks the Apple iPhone 14 Plus device and prevents anyone from using it until the correct credentials are entered. This is about verifying the ownership of the Apple iPhone 14 Plus device and works to deter theft of Apple devices.</p><h2 id="Part-II-Checking-If-Your-Apple-ID-Is-Locked"><a href="#Part-II-Checking-If-Your-Apple-ID-Is-Locked" class="headerlink" title="Part II: Checking If Your Apple ID Is Locked"></a>Part II: Checking If Your Apple ID Is Locked</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/10/unlock-apple-id-on-iphone-13-4.jpg"                      alt="the message of apple id locked"                ></p><p>A locked Apple ID is rather unmistakable. Your device would keep telling you that your Apple ID is locked for your security. Your Apple ID could be locked or disabled altogether if someone has tried to gain access to your account (and, obviously, failed). Apple would disable access to the Apple ID unless you are able to prove rightful ownership and reset the password successfully.</p><h2 id="Part-III-Reasons-for-Locked-Apple-ID"><a href="#Part-III-Reasons-for-Locked-Apple-ID" class="headerlink" title="Part III: Reasons for Locked Apple ID"></a>Part III: Reasons for Locked Apple ID</h2><p>There can be a few reasons why your Apple ID is locked. You forgot the password and now it is locked since you entered the wrong password too many times. A scarier prospect, albeit a real one, is that some malicious actor attempted to login into your Apple ID account but failed. Had they succeeded, you would have gotten a message that ‘your Apple ID is being used on another device’ now.</p><p>Apple does a lot to ensure that your Apple ID remains safe. You trust Apple with a lot of your data, including financial data by way of your credit cards associated with Apple ID to make purchases on the App Store and iTunes Store. Therefore, some of the time, Apple preempts issues by proactively locking up your Apple ID or even disabling it. It goes without saying that sometimes it is something so simple as a software error that is believed to have locked up Apple IDs for many users around the world a while ago. It is also entirely possible that it was some malicious actor probing the servers for accounts.</p><p>All of these will result in a locked Apple ID that users will have to reset their password to in order to gain access back.</p><h2 id="Part-IV-How-to-Unlock-Apple-ID-on-Apple-iPhone-14-Plus"><a href="#Part-IV-How-to-Unlock-Apple-ID-on-Apple-iPhone-14-Plus" class="headerlink" title="Part IV: How to Unlock Apple ID on Apple iPhone 14 Plus"></a>Part IV: How to Unlock Apple ID on Apple iPhone 14 Plus</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/10/unlock-apple-id-on-iphone-13-1.jpg"                      alt="apple id webpage"                ></p><p>It is unfortunate you are facing a locked Apple ID.

However, there can be several reasons that would have led to such circumstances, which are described as follows.</p><ul><li>There might be incorrect forced logging in into your Apple ID for multiple tries.</li><li>Any user would have entered incorrect security questions multiple times.</li><li>The other information associated with the Apple ID would have been entered incorrectly numerous times.</li></ul><h2 id="Part-2-Is-“Your-account-has-been-disabled-in-the-App-Store-and-iTunes”-the-same-as-“This-Apple-ID-has-been-disabled-for-security-reasons”"><a href="#Part-2-Is-“Your-account-has-been-disabled-in-the-App-Store-and-iTunes”-the-same-as-“This-Apple-ID-has-been-disabled-for-security-reasons”" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. Is “Your account has been disabled in the App Store and iTunes” the same as “This Apple ID has been disabled for security reasons”?"></a>Part 2. Is “Your account has been disabled in the App Store and iTunes” the same as “This Apple ID has been disabled for security reasons”?</h2><p>There are several instances where you encounter such prompt messages where you are restricted in using the App Store and iTunes. These messages can come in the form of “Your account has been disabled in the App Store and iTunes.” Over observing this prompt message, it has been discovered that the assorted message is not related to the other common message of “This Apple ID has been disabled for security reasons.” The dynamics of getting restricted from using the App Store and iTunes are related to remaining balances that have stuck around for a while over your Apple account. Normally, you may have some billing issues that are prevailing over an unpaid iTunes or App Store order. This problem can be countered through simplistic methods under such conditions where you are having access to the account information and can check for the basic billing information or update the payment method following other settings that are associated with paying bills. Over failure in accessing your account, you are required to contact Apple Support and look for the billing and payment statements to clear up all the remaining dues. Apple has considered covering all the security protocols to perfection, where you have any prevailing Apple charges on your connected credit card that would lead to direct disabling of your Apple Account.</p><p>Even though Apple accounts can be generally disabled overpayment issues, there are several security reasons that might restrict you in discovering and buying different products across the App Store and iTunes. It is necessary for you, as an Apple user, to remain prompt of all the issues that are relating to your Apple Account.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://proteahair.pxf.io/c/5597632/1983634/23621" target="_top" id="1983634"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/23621-1983634"                      border="0" alt="" width="320" height="100"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1983634/23621"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-3-2-tips-to-Unlock-Disabled-Apple-Account"><a href="#Part-3-2-tips-to-Unlock-Disabled-Apple-Account" class="headerlink" title="Part 3. 2 tips to Unlock Disabled Apple Account"></a>Part 3. 2 tips to Unlock Disabled Apple Account</h2><p>As this article provides you a detailed overview of the reasons that lead to your Apple Account getting disabled, this article also considers providing you a few tips and tricks that would guide you in efficiently unlocking your Apple Account and use it with ease.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://ursime.pxf.io/c/5597632/2092236/16384" target="_top" id="2092236"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16384-2092236"                      border="0" alt="" width="1920" height="329"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2092236/16384"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Unlock-disabled-Apple-account-with-Dr-Fone"><a href="#Unlock-disabled-Apple-account-with-Dr-Fone" class="headerlink" title="Unlock disabled Apple account with Dr. Fone"></a>Unlock disabled Apple account with Dr. Fone</h3><p>The first remedy that can be effectively tested across such situations that involve disabled Apple accounts is relating a third-party platform.

However, after enabling the function, many iPhone users forget to remove it from the FindMy app ahead of time. Therefore, if you are selling or resetting the Apple iPhone 14 Plus device, you need to <strong>remove AirTag from Apple ID</strong> to be usable later.</p><p>If someone removes the AirTag without resetting it while operating in the Bluetooth range, deleting AirTag ownership will require manually breaking the Apple iPhone 14 Plus device apart and further configuration.</p><p>Remove this connection from the Apple ID account with simple steps first-hand to avoid that. Read on to know the steps involved in this process directly or with the best software alternative.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/01/how-to-remove-airtag-from-apple-id-1.jpg"                      alt="remove airtag on iphone"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-Exactly-Does-an-AirTag-Do"><a href="#Part-1-What-Exactly-Does-an-AirTag-Do" class="headerlink" title="Part 1.

What Exactly Does an AirTag Do?</h2><p>Before discussing <strong>how to remove AirTag from Apple ID,</strong> you should know better about the function itself. The AirTag feature is available for iOS devices. Therefore, one can register the AirTag process with the Apple ID you are utilizing on your smartphone.</p><p>Apple users can attach the AirTag to different objects like backpacks or keychains. This makes it simple to find these objects later in case they get misplaced or lost through the Find My app on the iPhone.</p><p>Users can add their AirTag to one Apple ID account, so you cannot access this from the Find My app via other accounts. In case of loss, you must remove the AirTag from your device entirely.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/01/how-to-remove-airtag-from-apple-id-2.jpg"                      alt="airtag model"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Remove-an-AirTag-from-Your-Apple-ID-onApple-iPhone-14-Plus-iPad"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Remove-an-AirTag-from-Your-Apple-ID-onApple-iPhone-14-Plus-iPad" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

How to Remove an AirTag from Your Apple ID onApple iPhone 14 Plus &amp; iPad?</h2><p>After adding the AirTag to any object, it instantly syncs with the Apple ID of the user. So, only the primary Apple ID user can use or monitor the AirTagged item. Other users can use it only after resetting the AirTag.

Like with all good things in life, sometimes, a spanner is put in the works that bring your smooth-sailing life to an abrupt halt. With smartphones playing pivotal roles in our lives today, from payments to internet experiences to getting work done to stay in touch with people, anything that stops us from using our smartphone or endangers that experience is a cause for worry. A locked Apple ID is one such thing. It does not happen frequently, in fact, most users will never experience a locked Apple ID, but for the ones who are fortunate enough to have such a rare experience in life, help is at hand. All you need to do is relax and read on. By the end of it, you will have an unlocked Apple ID and you can go back to cruising.</p><h2 id="Part-I-Difference-Between-Activation-Lock-and-Locked-Apple-ID"><a href="#Part-I-Difference-Between-Activation-Lock-and-Locked-Apple-ID" class="headerlink" title="Part I: Difference Between Activation Lock and Locked Apple ID"></a>Part I: Difference Between Activation Lock and Locked Apple ID</h2><p>Apple being Apple, does a lot to make sure that users get the smoothest experience possible when interacting with their Apple products, both hardware, and software. Yet, sometimes, the messaging gets confusing, and people are not sure what is what. One such thing is the difference between iCloud Activation Lock and Apple ID Lock. While people are more likely to encounter Activation Lock and less likely to encounter Apple ID Lock, they are often confused when they encounter Apple ID Lock and struggle to figure out what that means and how to resolve the issue.</p><p>Activation Lock is when your supported Apple device is locked for a number of reasons. The most common reason is a stolen device that was locked by its owner, however, there are other perfectly valid reasons such as an outgoing employee forgetting to sign out and erase their Apple device before submitting it back. The IT department would not be able to reset that device without turning off Find My Apple iPhone 14 Plus and Activation Lock on the Apple iPhone 14 Plus device.</p><p>A locked Apple ID usually happens when the user has forgotten their password to their Apple ID account and attempts to figure out the password have been unsuccessful. Sometimes, Apple ID gets locked automatically under some conditions, and that requires users to reset their password to gain access. A locked Apple ID does not mean that your device is locked for your use. You can keep using it so long as you do not try to use another Apple ID with it since to do that you would have to sign out of your current Apple ID (which is locked) and you won’t be able to do that. On the other hand, Activation Lock renders the entire device unusable till the lock is cleared.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/10/unlock-apple-id-on-iphone-13-3.jpg"                      alt="apple id locked message"                ></p><p>In short, Apple ID Lock is about a user’s account with Apple, akin to how Google Account works on Android devices. Apple ID Lock locks a user’s account with Apple while retaining complete usage of the Apple iPhone 14 Plus device whereas Activation Lock locks the Apple iPhone 14 Plus device and prevents anyone from using it until the correct credentials are entered. This is about verifying the ownership of the Apple iPhone 14 Plus device and works to deter theft of Apple devices.</p><h2 id="Part-II-Checking-If-Your-Apple-ID-Is-Locked"><a href="#Part-II-Checking-If-Your-Apple-ID-Is-Locked" class="headerlink" title="Part II: Checking If Your Apple ID Is Locked"></a>Part II: Checking If Your Apple ID Is Locked</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/10/unlock-apple-id-on-iphone-13-4.jpg"                      alt="the message of apple id locked"                ></p><p>A locked Apple ID is rather unmistakable. Your device would keep telling you that your Apple ID is locked for your security. Your Apple ID could be locked or disabled altogether if someone has tried to gain access to your account (and, obviously, failed). Apple would disable access to the Apple ID unless you are able to prove rightful ownership and reset the password successfully.</p><h2 id="Part-III-Reasons-for-Locked-Apple-ID"><a href="#Part-III-Reasons-for-Locked-Apple-ID" class="headerlink" title="Part III: Reasons for Locked Apple ID"></a>Part III: Reasons for Locked Apple ID</h2><p>There can be a few reasons why your Apple ID is locked. You forgot the password and now it is locked since you entered the wrong password too many times. A scarier prospect, albeit a real one, is that some malicious actor attempted to login into your Apple ID account but failed. Had they succeeded, you would have gotten a message that ‘your Apple ID is being used on another device’ now.</p><p>Apple does a lot to ensure that your Apple ID remains safe. You trust Apple with a lot of your data, including financial data by way of your credit cards associated with Apple ID to make purchases on the App Store and iTunes Store. Therefore, some of the time, Apple preempts issues by proactively locking up your Apple ID or even disabling it. It goes without saying that sometimes it is something so simple as a software error that is believed to have locked up Apple IDs for many users around the world a while ago. It is also entirely possible that it was some malicious actor probing the servers for accounts.</p><p>All of these will result in a locked Apple ID that users will have to reset their password to in order to gain access back.</p><h2 id="Part-IV-How-to-Unlock-Apple-ID-on-Apple-iPhone-14-Plus"><a href="#Part-IV-How-to-Unlock-Apple-ID-on-Apple-iPhone-14-Plus" class="headerlink" title="Part IV: How to Unlock Apple ID on Apple iPhone 14 Plus"></a>Part IV: How to Unlock Apple ID on Apple iPhone 14 Plus</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/10/unlock-apple-id-on-iphone-13-1.jpg"                      alt="apple id webpage"                ></p><p>It is unfortunate you are facing a locked Apple ID. Apple tries its best to make users aware of safety protocols they need to follow to minimize and mitigate such unfortunate occurrences, such as using two-factor authentication, trusted devices, trusted phone numbers, passwords, passcodes, etc. that serve as deterrents to prevent unauthorized access to devices and accounts. Yet, when the unfortunate happens, what to do?</p><h3 id="IV-I-Unlock-Apple-ID-Via-Two-Factor-Authentication"><a href="#IV-I-Unlock-Apple-ID-Via-Two-Factor-Authentication" class="headerlink" title="IV.I: Unlock Apple ID Via Two-Factor Authentication"></a>IV.I: Unlock Apple ID Via Two-Factor Authentication</h3><p>Apple implemented two-factor authentication a long time ago to prevent unauthorized access to Apple ID accounts. If you have it enabled, you would be able to use two-factor authentication to unlock your Apple ID again.</p><p>Step 1: Go to <strong><a class="link"   href="https://iforgot.apple.com/" >https://iforgot.apple.com <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/10/unlock-apple-id-on-iphone-13-5.jpg"                      alt="apple id iforgot support page"                ></p><p>Step 2: Key in your Apple ID and proceed.</p><p>Step 3: Confirm your mobile number associated with the Apple ID.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/10/unlock-apple-id-on-iphone-13-6.jpg"                      alt="apple id iforgot support"                ></p><p>If you have another device associated with the Apple ID and it is a trusted device, you can now receive instructions to proceed with a two-factor code on that device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/10/unlock-apple-id-on-iphone-13-7.jpg"                      alt="using iforgot support page to unlock"                ></p><p>Step 4: Use that code to unlock your Apple ID using two-factor authentication.</p><h3 id="IV-II-Unlock-Apple-ID-Via-Dr-Fone-Screen-Unlock-iOS"><a href="#IV-II-Unlock-Apple-ID-Via-Dr-Fone-Screen-Unlock-iOS" class="headerlink" title="IV.II Unlock Apple ID Via Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS)"></a>IV.II Unlock Apple ID Via Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS)</h3><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/drfone-toolkit/" >Dr.Fone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a name that will be instantly familiar to anyone who has ever had any issue with their mobile devices and would be able to vouch for the quality and efficacy of this software at fixing issues quickly and efficiently.</p><p>Dr.Fone is a collection of carefully crafted modules that helps you when most needed.

We use our Apple ID for iCloud services on Apple devices, to make purchases on iTunes Store and App Store and payments using Apple Pay. Apple knows this and has checked in place to make sure that only you are in possession of your Apple ID account at all times. It can cause a little hassle at times, since if someone makes multiple failed attempts to gain access to your account, Apple will lock your Apple ID until you can unlock it with proper verifications and reset your password.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins><br><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://extra-support.techidaily.com/updated-maximizing-chances-to-engage-premier-filmmakers/"><u>[Updated] Maximizing Chances to Engage Premier Filmmakers</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-approaches.techidaily.com/updated-the-art-of-leading-lines-in-iphone-visual-storytelling/"><u>[Updated] The Art of Leading Lines in iPhone Visual Storytelling</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-knowledge.techidaily.com/2024-approved-probing-into-hdr-effectiveness-with-luminance-writings/"><u>2024 Approved  Probing Into HDR Effectiveness with Luminance’ Writings</u></a></li><li><a href="https://apple-account.techidaily.com/a-step-by-step-guide-to-finding-your-apple-id-from-your-iphone-xs-max-by-drfone-ios/"><u>A Step-by-Step Guide to Finding Your Apple ID From Your iPhone XS Max</u></a></li><li><a href="https://apple-account.techidaily.com/apple-id-locked-or-disabled-on-apple-iphone-12-mini-7-mehtods-you-cant-miss-by-drfone-ios/"><u>Apple ID Locked or Disabled On Apple iPhone 12 mini? 7 Mehtods You Cant-Miss</u></a></li><li><a href="https://apple-account.techidaily.com/apple-id-locked-or-disabled-on-iphone-11-pro-7-mehtods-you-cant-miss-by-drfone-ios/"><u>Apple ID Locked or Disabled On iPhone 11 Pro? 7 Mehtods You Cant-Miss</u></a></li><li><a href="https://apple-account.techidaily.com/apple-id-unlock-from-iphone-8-how-to-fix-it-by-drfone-ios/"><u>Apple ID Unlock From iPhone 8?

Choose the “Screen Unlock” option from the menu.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png"                      alt="drfone home"                ></p><p>The interface will present another set of options before you. You need to access the one at the end, which says, “Unlock Apple ID.” Choose the option and begin to remove Apple ID from the iPhone.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/android-screen-unlock-2.png"                      alt="drfone android ios unlock"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2: Enter Screen Password</strong></p><p>Dr.Fone will not be able to detect your device just yet. You need to tap the “Trust this Computer” option on your phone, and then Dr.Fone will begin to access your device. It would help if you kept in mind that proceeding with this process will wipe all your Apple iPhone 14 Plus data.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/drfone/trust-computer.jpg"                      alt="trust computer"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3: Reset all your Apple iPhone 14 Plus Settings</strong></p><p>Dr.Fone will present a set of instructions for you to follow. Stick to these steps and reset all your Apple iPhone 14 Plus settings. Once this is done, the Apple iPhone 14 Plus will reboot, and the process to unlock your Apple iPhone 14 Plus will begin.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/drfone/interface.jpg"                      alt="interface"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4: Unlock the iPhone</strong></p><p>The unlocking process will begin once your Apple iPhone 14 Plus has finished resetting. Removing the Apple ID from your phone will only take a couple of seconds.</p><p>Once the process is finished, make sure the Apple ID is no longer there. Proceed to your settings and check if Dr.Fone has removed the Apple ID.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/remove-apple-id-8.png"                      alt="complete"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-Remove-Apple-ID-from-iPhone-without-Password-with-iCloud-com"><a href="#Part-2-Remove-Apple-ID-from-iPhone-without-Password-with-iCloud-com" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

This starts with the quality of hardware and the synergy with the software that runs the hardware, and the user experience you get. Apple puts great emphasis on this, and rightly so, for this is one of the keys defining and differentiating factors for people to choose Apple’s iOS over Google’s Android. Like with all good things in life, sometimes, a spanner is put in the works that bring your smooth-sailing life to an abrupt halt. With smartphones playing pivotal roles in our lives today, from payments to internet experiences to getting work done to stay in touch with people, anything that stops us from using our smartphone or endangers that experience is a cause for worry. A locked Apple ID is one such thing. It does not happen frequently, in fact, most users will never experience a locked Apple ID, but for the ones who are fortunate enough to have such a rare experience in life, help is at hand. All you need to do is relax and read on. By the end of it, you will have an unlocked Apple ID and you can go back to cruising.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://ursime.pxf.io/c/5597632/2048972/16384" target="_top" id="2048972"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16384-2048972"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="900"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2048972/16384"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-I-Difference-Between-Activation-Lock-and-Locked-Apple-ID"><a href="#Part-I-Difference-Between-Activation-Lock-and-Locked-Apple-ID" class="headerlink" title="Part I: Difference Between Activation Lock and Locked Apple ID"></a>Part I: Difference Between Activation Lock and Locked Apple ID</h2><p>Apple being Apple, does a lot to make sure that users get the smoothest experience possible when interacting with their Apple products, both hardware, and software. Yet, sometimes, the messaging gets confusing, and people are not sure what is what. One such thing is the difference between iCloud Activation Lock and Apple ID Lock. While people are more likely to encounter Activation Lock and less likely to encounter Apple ID Lock, they are often confused when they encounter Apple ID Lock and struggle to figure out what that means and how to resolve the issue.</p><p>Activation Lock is when your supported Apple device is locked for a number of reasons. The most common reason is a stolen device that was locked by its owner, however, there are other perfectly valid reasons such as an outgoing employee forgetting to sign out and erase their Apple device before submitting it back. The IT department would not be able to reset that device without turning off Find My Apple iPhone 14 Plus and Activation Lock on the Apple iPhone 14 Plus device.</p><p>A locked Apple ID usually happens when the user has forgotten their password to their Apple ID account and attempts to figure out the password have been unsuccessful. Sometimes, Apple ID gets locked automatically under some conditions, and that requires users to reset their password to gain access. A locked Apple ID does not mean that your device is locked for your use. You can keep using it so long as you do not try to use another Apple ID with it since to do that you would have to sign out of your current Apple ID (which is locked) and you won’t be able to do that. On the other hand, Activation Lock renders the entire device unusable till the lock is cleared.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/10/unlock-apple-id-on-iphone-13-3.jpg"                      alt="apple id locked message"                ></p><p>In short, Apple ID Lock is about a user’s account with Apple, akin to how Google Account works on Android devices. Apple ID Lock locks a user’s account with Apple while retaining complete usage of the Apple iPhone 14 Plus device whereas Activation Lock locks the Apple iPhone 14 Plus device and prevents anyone from using it until the correct credentials are entered. This is about verifying the ownership of the Apple iPhone 14 Plus device and works to deter theft of Apple devices.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://store.iobit.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=1468905&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/184260348236f9554fe9375772ff966e/ascscan_728x90.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-II-Checking-If-Your-Apple-ID-Is-Locked"><a href="#Part-II-Checking-If-Your-Apple-ID-Is-Locked" class="headerlink" title="Part II: Checking If Your Apple ID Is Locked"></a>Part II: Checking If Your Apple ID Is Locked</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/10/unlock-apple-id-on-iphone-13-4.jpg"                      alt="the message of apple id locked"                ></p><p>A locked Apple ID is rather unmistakable. Your device would keep telling you that your Apple ID is locked for your security. Your Apple ID could be locked or disabled altogether if someone has tried to gain access to your account (and, obviously, failed). Apple would disable access to the Apple ID unless you are able to prove rightful ownership and reset the password successfully.</p><h2 id="Part-III-Reasons-for-Locked-Apple-ID"><a href="#Part-III-Reasons-for-Locked-Apple-ID" class="headerlink" title="Part III: Reasons for Locked Apple ID"></a>Part III: Reasons for Locked Apple ID</h2><p>There can be a few reasons why your Apple ID is locked. You forgot the password and now it is locked since you entered the wrong password too many times. A scarier prospect, albeit a real one, is that some malicious actor attempted to login into your Apple ID account but failed. Had they succeeded, you would have gotten a message that ‘your Apple ID is being used on another device’ now.</p><p>Apple does a lot to ensure that your Apple ID remains safe. You trust Apple with a lot of your data, including financial data by way of your credit cards associated with Apple ID to make purchases on the App Store and iTunes Store. Therefore, some of the time, Apple preempts issues by proactively locking up your Apple ID or even disabling it. It goes without saying that sometimes it is something so simple as a software error that is believed to have locked up Apple IDs for many users around the world a while ago. It is also entirely possible that it was some malicious actor probing the servers for accounts.</p><p>All of these will result in a locked Apple ID that users will have to reset their password to in order to gain access back.</p><h2 id="Part-IV-How-to-Unlock-Apple-ID-on-Apple-iPhone-14-Plus"><a href="#Part-IV-How-to-Unlock-Apple-ID-on-Apple-iPhone-14-Plus" class="headerlink" title="Part IV: How to Unlock Apple ID on Apple iPhone 14 Plus"></a>Part IV: How to Unlock Apple ID on Apple iPhone 14 Plus</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/10/unlock-apple-id-on-iphone-13-1.jpg"                      alt="apple id webpage"                ></p><p>It is unfortunate you are facing a locked Apple ID. Apple tries its best to make users aware of safety protocols they need to follow to minimize and mitigate such unfortunate occurrences, such as using two-factor authentication, trusted devices, trusted phone numbers, passwords, passcodes, etc. that serve as deterrents to prevent unauthorized access to devices and accounts. Yet, when the unfortunate happens, what to do?</p><h3 id="IV-I-Unlock-Apple-ID-Via-Two-Factor-Authentication"><a href="#IV-I-Unlock-Apple-ID-Via-Two-Factor-Authentication" class="headerlink" title="IV.I: Unlock Apple ID Via Two-Factor Authentication"></a>IV.I: Unlock Apple ID Via Two-Factor Authentication</h3><p>Apple implemented two-factor authentication a long time ago to prevent unauthorized access to Apple ID accounts.

It can be used to login into every Apple service, from Apple Music to FaceTime. However, there are many reasons which can force you to remove your Apple ID from devices like MacBook, iPhone, etc. That makes it important for you to learn <strong>how to remove Apple ID from your MacBook</strong> safely.</p><p>Suppose you need to <strong>remove your Apple ID from your Mac</strong> but don’t know to do this, then this article is for you. You will also learn to remove Apple ID from iOS devices without a password.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://ukaidot.sjv.io/c/5597632/1793234/19578" target="_top" id="1793234"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19578-1793234"                      border="0" alt="" width="678" height="452"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1793234/19578"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/01/how-to-remove-apple-id-from-your-mac-1.jpg"                      alt="remove apple id from mac"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-Why-Delete-Apple-ID-and-iCloud-Account"><a href="#Part-1-Why-Delete-Apple-ID-and-iCloud-Account" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Why Delete Apple ID and iCloud Account?"></a>Part 1: Why Delete Apple ID and iCloud Account?</h2><p>There are as many reasons to leave the Apple ecosystem as why you should join it. Apple devices are known for security, but it also means that you have less control over their settings. It is also a closed ecosystem that forces you to limit yourself to a specific set of apps and services. Some of the reasons why people might want to <strong>remove their Apple ID from their MacBook</strong> are the following:</p><ul><li><strong>Switching Platforms:</strong> If you intend to leave Apple devices and move to another platform like Android, it makes sense to delete the Apple ID. Deleting the ID will make it safer for you to sell your old Apple device to others.</li><li><strong>Privacy Concerns:</strong> While Apple is comparatively secure, your data is still stored on Apple servers. It means the company can still access your data. It will require deleting your Apple ID if you want to delete all personal data from Apple servers.</li><li><strong>Changing Account:</strong> Getting a new Apple ID means you need to delete your old Apple ID. It will save you the trouble of managing two different IDs with multiple accounts associated with each one.</li><li><strong>Shared Apple ID:</strong> It is possible that you were sharing your account with your partner or another family member and now want to get your own account. Removing the old account completely and using a new one can be the safest way.</li></ul><h2 id="Part-2-If-I-Delete-Apple-ID-Will-I-Lose-Everything"><a href="#Part-2-If-I-Delete-Apple-ID-Will-I-Lose-Everything" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: If I Delete Apple ID, Will I Lose Everything?"></a>Part 2: If I Delete Apple ID, Will I Lose Everything?</h2><p>Deleting your Apple ID is not insignificant because it is your key to the Apple ecosystem, as mentioned above. Though it won’t affect your data storage in local device. However, you will no longer be able to access your data store across multiple Apple services like iCloud, Apple Music, FaceTime, iMessage, or other services that require an Apple ID can no longer be used.</p><p>You won’t be able to purchase or access purchased items from the App Store, iTunes Store, or other Apple services. Remember, deleting your Apple ID is a permanent action and cannot be undone.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Remove-Apple-ID-iCloud-Account-from-Mac-with-Password"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Remove-Apple-ID-iCloud-Account-from-Mac-with-Password" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Remove Apple ID&#x2F;iCloud Account from Mac with Password?"></a>Part 3: How to Remove Apple ID&#x2F;iCloud Account from Mac with Password?</h2><p>The process of removing Apple ID from a Mac is easy and quick. Before removing the Apple ID, you need to remember that all the services that require Apple ID will no longer work. To <strong>remove the Apple ID from your</strong> <strong>MacBook</strong>, follow these steps:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open your Mac and access the “System Settings” from the “Apple Logo” icon. Here, click on your Apple ID name from the top of the left sidebar. Scroll to the bottom of the Apple ID tab to locate the “Sign Out” button.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/01/how-to-remove-apple-id-from-your-mac-2.jpg"                      alt="access the apple id settings"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Press the “Sign Out” button to remove your Apple ID from the Mac. A prompt will appear asking if you want to keep a copy of your passwords and contacts on your laptop. Select them according to your needs.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/01/how-to-remove-apple-id-from-your-mac-3.jpg"                      alt="select the data to copy"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> On the next window, it will ask you to provide your Apple ID password.

Another such case is buying a second-hand iPhone with a logged-in Apple ID without knowing the password. You need a specialized tool like <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/iphone-unlock/" >Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to remove Apple ID in these cases.</p><p>With Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS), you can remove the Apple ID from your Apple iPhone 14 Plus or iPad and regain access to the Apple iPhone 14 Plus device.

Here’s the step by step guide on how the process works.</p><p><strong>Step 1: Install Dr.Fone on your Computer</strong></p><p>Install the software. Launch it and connect your Apple iPhone 14 Plus to the computer using a USB cable. Choose the “Screen Unlock” option from the menu.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png"                      alt="drfone home"                ></p><p>The interface will present another set of options before you. You need to access the one at the end, which says, “Unlock Apple ID.” Choose the option and begin to remove Apple ID from the iPhone.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/android-screen-unlock-2.png"                      alt="drfone android ios unlock"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2: Enter Screen Password</strong></p><p>Dr.Fone will not be able to detect your device just yet. You need to tap the “Trust this Computer” option on your phone, and then Dr.Fone will begin to access your device. It would help if you kept in mind that proceeding with this process will wipe all your Apple iPhone 14 Plus data.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/drfone/trust-computer.jpg"                      alt="trust computer"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3: Reset all your Apple iPhone 14 Plus Settings</strong></p><p>Dr.Fone will present a set of instructions for you to follow. Stick to these steps and reset all your Apple iPhone 14 Plus settings. Once this is done, the Apple iPhone 14 Plus will reboot, and the process to unlock your Apple iPhone 14 Plus will begin.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/drfone/interface.jpg"                      alt="interface"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4: Unlock the iPhone</strong></p><p>The unlocking process will begin once your Apple iPhone 14 Plus has finished resetting. Removing the Apple ID from your phone will only take a couple of seconds.</p><p>Once the process is finished, make sure the Apple ID is no longer there. Proceed to your settings and check if Dr.Fone has removed the Apple ID.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/remove-apple-id-8.png"                      alt="complete"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-Remove-Apple-ID-from-iPhone-without-Password-with-iCloud-com"><a href="#Part-2-Remove-Apple-ID-from-iPhone-without-Password-with-iCloud-com" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.
