So before you further into anything more complicated, make sure you’re using the latest GPU driver. This could help avoid a lot of strange issues.</p><p> There’re mainly 2 ways you can update your graphics driver: manually or automatically.</p><h4 id="Option-1-Update-your-graphics-driver-manually"><a href="#Option-1-Update-your-graphics-driver-manually" class="headerlink" title="Option 1: Update your graphics driver manually"></a>Option 1: Update your graphics driver manually</h4><p> If you’re a tech-savvy gamer, you can spend some time updating your GPU driver manually.</p><p>To do so, first visit the website of your GPU manufacturer:</p><ul><li><strong><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/" >NVIDIA <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></li><li><strong><a class="link"   href="https://www.amd.com/en/support" >AMD <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></li><li><strong><a class="link"   href="https://downloadcenter.intel.com/product/80939/Graphics" >Intel <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></li></ul><p> Then search for your GPU model.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Turning-Off-Two-Factor-Authentication-On-Apple-iPhone-15-Pro-Max-5-Tips-You-Must-Know"><a href="#Turning-Off-Two-Factor-Authentication-On-Apple-iPhone-15-Pro-Max-5-Tips-You-Must-Know" class="headerlink" title="Turning Off Two Factor Authentication On Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max? 5 Tips You Must Know"></a>Turning Off Two Factor Authentication On Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max? 5 Tips You Must Know</h2><p>Apple has produced one of the most consumed, acknowledged, and preferred smartphones that allowed them to rule the industry for a considerably long period of time. Their style and presentation were not the only reason that made people look forward to buying an iPhone. Apple created its own operating system and presented their own versions of security and protection. One of the most recognized and impeccable features offered by Apple in its innovative structure was the security and safety through Apple ID and Apple Account. Every important feature that operated throughout the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max or iPad was focused over a single entity, the Apple ID. However, apart from the Apple ID, there were several other layers of authentications and verifications that were added throughout the protocol structure. A couple of them are renowned as Two Factor Verification and Two Factor Authentication. This article produces a very generous set of advice that should be looked over while handing these layers of protection. To get a better understanding of the procedures involved, you need to look over the guide to gain better knowledge on how to turn off Two Factor Authentication on your Apple.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2020/11/two-factor-authentication-apple.jpg"                      alt="two factor authentication apple"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-Is-two-step-verification-the-same-as-two-factor-authentication"><a href="#Part-1-Is-two-step-verification-the-same-as-two-factor-authentication" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. Is two-step verification the same as two-factor authentication?"></a>Part 1. Is two-step verification the same as two-factor authentication?</h2><p>There might be a few differences involved in these two security models; however, it should be kept in mind that they focus their purpose on securing the Apple ID of the user. Two Factor Verification is a security protocol that protects access to the various activities performed through the Apple ID. It attenuates an extra verification step across the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device in addition to the password for the Apple ID. The device receives a verification code from an authentication factor that allows the authorities to confirm the credibility of the user.</p><p>The Two Factor Authentication is considered as an upgrade to the Two Factor Verification, which was released two years after the Two Factor Verification, in 2015. This authentication method exempted the offline recovery keys and application-specific passcodes. They added a six-digit authentication code onto the original password and produced an offline, time-dependent code that is to be generated through the Settings of the trusted device of the user. This feature was appended into the iOS 9 and OS X El Capitan with a region-specific target.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-turn-off-two-step-verification"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-turn-off-two-step-verification" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. How to turn off two-step verification?"></a>Part 2. How to turn off two-step verification?</h2><p>As you are aware of the Two-Step Verification process, it is quite easy and typical in configuring. However, when it comes to turning the settings off, it is also a simple and straightforward procedure that can be easily covered by following the steps provided below.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> You are required to open the Apple ID Account web page on your browser and sign in with your Apple ID credentials.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> As you log into the website, access the “Security” section, and tap “Edit” from the options provided on the list.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Tap on the “Two-Step Verification” option and turn it off. Confirm to conclude the process. You may be required to select the new security questions and verify the data of birth in the process. As you would be done with it, an email would be received across your connected address for confirmation.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-turn-off-two-factor-authentication-lower-than-iOS-10-3"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-turn-off-two-factor-authentication-lower-than-iOS-10-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 3. How to turn off two-factor authentication? (lower than iOS 10.3)"></a>Part 3. How to turn off two-factor authentication? (lower than iOS 10.3)</h2><p>Two Factor Authentication cannot be turned off in a few cases and accounts for iOS versions greater than 10.3. However, if you have activated Two Factor Authentication across the iOS versions lower than 10.3, you can deactivate the feature through a series of simple steps. The exemption of this security feature across your device leaves it protected only through a password and a few security questions. For turning off the Two Factor Authentication from your Apple device, you need to follow the steps provided as follows:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open your browser and access your Apple ID Account website. Provide the details of your Apple ID and log in.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Tap on “Edit” in the “Security” section and turn off the “Two Factor Authentication” option.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> This would lead you to set new security questions for the Apple ID account, followed by a verification of your date of birth. The successful execution of the process would lead to turning it off.</p><h2 id="Part-4-Why-can’t-you-turn-off-two-factor-authentication-if-you-already-use-it-iOS-10-3-and-later"><a href="#Part-4-Why-can’t-you-turn-off-two-factor-authentication-if-you-already-use-it-iOS-10-3-and-later" class="headerlink" title="Part 4. Why can’t you turn off two-factor authentication if you already use it? (iOS 10.3 and later)"></a>Part 4. Why can’t you turn off two-factor authentication if you already use it? (iOS 10.3 and later)</h2><p>For users who have an Apple device with an iOS 10.3 or later version, they cannot turn the Two Factor Authentication off after it is accessed. The latest iOS and macOS included extra layers of security in their features, which led towards a better security foundation and protection of information. Users who have updated their account information can unenroll in two weeks after updating. For this, you are required to simply access the confirmation email that you have received and tap on the link to approach the previous security settings. Thus, it makes it far more than impossible for users to turn their Two Factor Authentication off if they consider it unnecessary for their device. This feature is something that would always remain intact with their device as an extra layer of security. Its absence does leave a chance of illegal access to the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device and an increased risk of a security breach. Since it is directly built across the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device and its settings, this makes it a very hard-to-approach characteristic.</p><h2 id="Part-5-How-to-turn-off-two-factor-authentication-by-removing-Apple-ID"><a href="#Part-5-How-to-turn-off-two-factor-authentication-by-removing-Apple-ID" class="headerlink" title="Part 5.

Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> Microsoft is no stranger to computers and their accessories, and it’s obvious with the Microsoft Surface Keyboard that they’ve put a considerable amount of thought into its design. This<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-ergonomic-keyboards-4147386" >ergonomic keyboard <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is not only built with high-quality materials to ensure its longevity, but it’s comfortable and intuitive to use. We tested this keyboard over the period of a week, read on to see what we found.</p><h2 id="Design-Sleek-and-comfortable"><a href="#Design-Sleek-and-comfortable" class="headerlink" title="Design: Sleek and comfortable"></a><strong>Design: Sleek and comfortable</strong></h2><p> The Surface is a sleek ergonomic keyboard and a welcome addition to the Microsoft family. Like many ergonomic keyboards, it’s designed to help your wrists sit at an instinctive, comfortable angle that encourages natural movement to prevent<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/game-play-and-streaming-4781449" >repetitive stress injuries <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . The keys have a slight divot in the center so fingers naturally conform to their shape, making the keys comfortable and easy to type on.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/XepNCNj18GnNs8V1INrxR7tnMGo=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Microsoft_ErgoKeyboards_4LW4147386_04-1edde9a5b2264b4abb528945ffae167f.jpg"                      alt="Microsoft Surface Ergonomic Keyboard"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Emily Isaacs</p><p> The sloped, ergonomic design is built using high-quality, tactile materials that are not only intuitive to type on, but oddly satisfying as well. As with anything new, there’s still a period of adjustment, but we didn’t find the change to be a jarring experience. The Surface has the added bonus of featuring Alcantara fabric, a proprietary Italian material that’s a combination of polyester and polyurethane with a suede-like feel to it. It uses the Alcantara fabric as part of the wrist pad making it not only and soft to the touch, but easy to clean and maintain as well.</p><p> The Surface keyboard features a split design that’s not dissimilar to the manta ray shape employed by the Microsoft Sculpt, a direct competitor to the Surface. It’s as if Microsoft lifted that product design and built upon it to create something better—and more attractive. The two halves of the keyboard swoop outward and downward, putting hands, wrists, and arms in a natural position.</p><p> It’s the Goldilocks of keyboards with a fit that feels just right.</p><p> Unlike some ergonomic keyboards that can hog space, forcing users to overreach for mice which can lead to shoulder injuries in place of wrist injuries, the Surface is wide enough that your hands sit comfortably but small enough that it’s easy to reach for your mouse when you want it. It’s the Goldilocks of keyboards with a fit that feels just right.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1925468/19272" target="_top" id="1925468">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1925468" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1925468/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Setup-Process-Easy-for-PCs"><a href="#Setup-Process-Easy-for-PCs" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: Easy for PCs"></a><strong>Setup Process: Easy for PCs</strong></h2><p> The Microsoft Surface Ergonomic Keyboard arrives in a mid-size box containing the Surface itself as well as a small white box tucked underneath it.

Next, we pressed the Bluetooth button and flipped it over to the frontside where a white light flashed above the arrow pad to indicate that it was ready for pairing. On our PC, we navigated to the Bluetooth settings and selected the Microsoft Surface Ergonomic Keyboard. It prompted us to input a numeric code and press enter in order to finalize the setup process.

If you do need to change them, it’s easy to press the battery compartment lid down so that it pops out to replace them.

Between the quality of the build materials, the comfort of the keyboard’s design, its wireless capabilities, and its great battery life, the Surface is a worthwhile investment for people who spend a significant amount of time in front of a PC. If you don’t spend much time on your PC, however, a cheaper, non-ergonomic model may be a better fit.</p><h2 id="Microsoft-Surface-Ergonomic-Keyboard-vs-Microsoft-Sculpt-Ergonomic-Keyboard"><a href="#Microsoft-Surface-Ergonomic-Keyboard-vs-Microsoft-Sculpt-Ergonomic-Keyboard" class="headerlink" title="Microsoft Surface Ergonomic Keyboard vs. Microsoft Sculpt Ergonomic Keyboard"></a><strong>Microsoft Surface Ergonomic Keyboard vs. Microsoft Sculpt Ergonomic Keyboard</strong></h2><p> The Microsoft Sculpt Ergonomic Keyboard is a direct competitor to the Surface. Interestingly, the Sculpt seems to have inspired a significant portion of the Surface’s design, with the Surface feeling like a fancier version of the Sculpt thanks to its quality materials and matte finish. This difference shows in their price points as well, with the Sculpt generally retailing for around $80 whereas the Surface retails for around $129 (MSRP) or $100 on Amazon.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/microsoft-sculpt-ergonomic-keyboard-review-4780274" >Microsoft Sculpt Ergonomic Keyboard Review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/V-eFQKJrpei_UnaKMYDEWLLNsYw=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Microsoft_ErgoKeyboards_4LW4147386_02-4fa6aa53c9d249a6900cb4058b084301.jpg"                      alt="Microsoft Surface Ergonomic Keyboard"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2082535/7443" target="_top" id="2082535">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2082535" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2082535/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Emily Isaacs</p><p> A second version of the Sculpt is available for this same $129 price point, the notable difference being that it includes a wireless mouse which associates to the computer through the keyboard’s encrypted dongle. If you have limited<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-usb-port-818166" >USB ports <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , this may be especially appealing to you.</p><p> The Sculpt is slightly smaller and made of plastic, although it also features a cushioned wrist pad. The wrist pad in the Sculpt is a bit firm, but it’s not uncomfortable. The Sculpt also comes with an optional magnetic riser that attaches to the bottom of the keyboard. It raises the wrist pad, thus altering the pitch of the keyboard itself into a more neutral position for your wrist. If you prefer to work on a raised surface or at a more neutral angle, the Sculpt is the clear winner. Another notable difference between the two is that the Sculpt offers a detached numpad. If you do a significant amount of work in<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/excel-4781563" >spreadsheets <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> with numbers, this feature can be a game-changer.</p><p> The Surface features a split design that’s not dissimilar to the manta ray shape employed by the Microsoft Sculpt, a direct competitor to the Surface.</p><p> While the Sculpt, like the Surface, is also wireless, it pairs to computers via an encrypted Bluetooth dongle that’s associated with the keyboard when it’s built at the factory. One drawback to this dongle, however, is that if it’s lost or damaged, it’s irreplaceable. If you’re concerned about misplacing the encrypted Bluetooth dongle the Sculpt uses, the Surface is the model for you.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p> <strong>An almost flawless keyboard that’s worth the price.</strong></p><p> The Microsoft Surface Ergonomic Keyboard is a quality, wireless ergonomic keyboard that’s well worth the investment if you spend a significant portion of your time typing on your computer. It’s a splurge to be sure, but it’s worth the price for the quality you receive.</p><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  Surface Ergonomic Keyboard</li><li>Product Brand  Microsoft</li><li>Price  $129.99</li><li>Weight  2.23 lbs.</li><li>Product Dimensions  18.11 x 9.02 x 1.36 in.</li><li>Product Number  3RA-00022</li><li>Compatibility  Surface Pro 4, Surface Book, Surface Studio and other Windows devices, Mac OS 10.10.5 and higher</li><li>Mobile Compatibility  Android 4.2 and above, iOS 8 &amp; 9</li><li>Bluetooth T  4.0</li><li>Range  32 ft.</li><li>Battery  2 AAA Alkaline batteries (included)</li><li>Battery Life  Up to 12 months</li><li>Warranty  1-year limited warranty</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://article-files.techidaily.com/new-beginners-blueprint-progressive-sound-intensity-rise-for-2024/"><u>[New] Beginner’s Blueprint Progressive Sound Intensity Rise for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vp-tips.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-navigating-the-world-of-vivacut-video-editing-insights/"><u>[New] In 2024, Navigating the World of VivaCut Video Editing - Insights</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-record-videos.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-budget-friendly-strategies-to-infuse-text-and-video/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Budget-Friendly Strategies to Infuse Text & Video</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-approaches.techidaily.com/fb-windows-macbook-iphone-and-android/"><u>最適なファイル形式でFB動画ダウンロード - Windows, MacBook, iPhone & Android対応</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fix-guide.techidaily.com/does-find-my-friends-work-on-google-pixel-8-pro-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>Does find my friends work on Google Pixel 8 Pro | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-content.techidaily.com/elevating-your-entertainment-game-on-roku-and-facebook-live-for-2024/"><u>Elevating Your Entertainment Game on Roku and Facebook LIVE for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-information.techidaily.com/how-to-optimize-your-viewing-a-guide-to-high-definition-cricket-live-streaming/"><u>How to Optimize Your Viewing A Guide to High-Definition Cricket Live Streaming</u></a></li><li><a href="https://apple-account.techidaily.com/how-to-remove-iphone-12-pro-max-device-from-icloud-by-drfone-ios/"><u>How to Remove iPhone 12 Pro Max Device from iCloud</u></a></li><li><a href="https://apple-account.techidaily.com/how-to-sign-out-of-apple-id-from-iphone-11-pro-without-password-by-drfone-ios/"><u>How to Sign Out of Apple ID From iPhone 11 Pro without Password?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://apple-account.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-delete-icloud-account-on-iphone-15-pro-without-password-by-drfone-ios/"><u>In 2024, How to Delete iCloud Account On iPhone 15 Pro without Password?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://apple-account.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-fix-apple-id-verification-code-not-working-from-iphone-14-plus-by-drfone-ios/"><u>In 2024, How To Fix Apple ID Verification Code Not Working From iPhone 14 Plus</u></a></li><li><a href="https://apple-account.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-reset-the-security-questions-of-your-apple-id-on-your-iphone-12-by-drfone-ios/"><u>In 2024, How To Reset the Security Questions of Your Apple ID On Your iPhone 12</u></a></li><li><a href="https://activate-lock.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-unlock-icloud-lock-from-your-apple-iphone-12-mini-and-ipad-by-drfone-ios/"><u>In 2024, How to Unlock iCloud lock from your Apple iPhone 12 mini and iPad?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-pokemon-go.techidaily.com/in-2024-pokemon-go-cooldown-chart-on-tecno-pop-8-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, Pokémon Go Cooldown Chart On Tecno Pop 8 | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://apple-account.techidaily.com/in-2024-removing-device-from-apple-id-for-your-iphone-12-pro-max-by-drfone-ios/"><u>In 2024, Removing Device From Apple ID For your iPhone 12 Pro Max</u></a></li><li><a href="https://apple-account.techidaily.com/your-account-has-been-disabled-in-the-app-store-and-itunes-from-apple-iphone-xs-by-drfone-ios/"><u>Your Account Has Been Disabled in the App Store and iTunes From Apple iPhone XS?</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

How to Fix"></a>Why Apple Account Disabled On your Apple iPhone 13 Pro? How to Fix</h2><p>Apple is one of the leading smartphone developing enterprises that has introduced the world to a contemporary set of features that are not common among other leading smartphone companies. One of the major distinguishing characteristics of Apple has been displayed in its present security protocols. Apple Account is regarded as one of the most significant credentials of the Apple iPhone 13 Pro and iPad that is responsible for connecting and holding the applications and the assorted data. Many users have generally reported unusual situations that got their Apple Account disabled. There are several reasons that can be associated with the Apple account getting disabled. The major repercussion that is associated with it is unnecessary data loss following the suspension of all products that have been bought with the account over time. This article provides you an impressive overview of the major reasons that lead to your Apple Account getting disabled, followed by the associated mechanisms that can be tested to secure the account.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Why-is-the-Apple-account-disabled"><a href="#Part-1-Why-is-the-Apple-account-disabled" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. Why is the Apple account disabled?"></a>Part 1. Why is the Apple account disabled?</h2><p>Apple iPhone, iPad, and other devices operate over a single Operating System, with its own protocols and unique mechanisms that distinguish it from other smartphone models in the market. Apple believes in securing the data and identification of its users with its state-of-the-art security measures. Under such circumstances, it usually gets possible for the user to have his Apple account disabled unnecessarily. Whenever you encounter such a situation, there are several messages that might be displayed on your device to prompt you over the disabling of the account. These messages usually appear in situations where you intend to sign in to some platform with your associated Apple ID. The most common messages that appear on the screen are:</p><ul><li>“This Apple ID has been disabled for security reasons.”</li><li>“You can’t sign in because your account was disabled for security reasons.”</li><li>“This Apple ID has been locked for security reasons.”</li></ul><p>The messages that have been stated above are usually depicting a security anomaly that led to the disabling of the associated Apple ID. However, there can be several reasons that would have led to such circumstances, which are described as follows.</p><ul><li>There might be incorrect forced logging in into your Apple ID for multiple tries.</li><li>Any user would have entered incorrect security questions multiple times.</li><li>The other information associated with the Apple ID would have been entered incorrectly numerous times.</li></ul><h2 id="Part-2-Is-“Your-account-has-been-disabled-in-the-App-Store-and-iTunes”-the-same-as-“This-Apple-ID-has-been-disabled-for-security-reasons”"><a href="#Part-2-Is-“Your-account-has-been-disabled-in-the-App-Store-and-iTunes”-the-same-as-“This-Apple-ID-has-been-disabled-for-security-reasons”" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

Is “Your account has been disabled in the App Store and iTunes” the same as “This Apple ID has been disabled for security reasons”?</h2><p>There are several instances where you encounter such prompt messages where you are restricted in using the App Store and iTunes. These messages can come in the form of “Your account has been disabled in the App Store and iTunes.” Over observing this prompt message, it has been discovered that the assorted message is not related to the other common message of “This Apple ID has been disabled for security reasons.” The dynamics of getting restricted from using the App Store and iTunes are related to remaining balances that have stuck around for a while over your Apple account. Normally, you may have some billing issues that are prevailing over an unpaid iTunes or App Store order. This problem can be countered through simplistic methods under such conditions where you are having access to the account information and can check for the basic billing information or update the payment method following other settings that are associated with paying bills. Over failure in accessing your account, you are required to contact Apple Support and look for the billing and payment statements to clear up all the remaining dues. Apple has considered covering all the security protocols to perfection, where you have any prevailing Apple charges on your connected credit card that would lead to direct disabling of your Apple Account.</p><p>Even though Apple accounts can be generally disabled overpayment issues, there are several security reasons that might restrict you in discovering and buying different products across the App Store and iTunes. It is necessary for you, as an Apple user, to remain prompt of all the issues that are relating to your Apple Account.</p><h2 id="Part-3-2-tips-to-Unlock-Disabled-Apple-Account"><a href="#Part-3-2-tips-to-Unlock-Disabled-Apple-Account" class="headerlink" title="Part 3. 2 tips to Unlock Disabled Apple Account"></a>Part 3. 2 tips to Unlock Disabled Apple Account</h2><p>As this article provides you a detailed overview of the reasons that lead to your Apple Account getting disabled, this article also considers providing you a few tips and tricks that would guide you in efficiently unlocking your Apple Account and use it with ease.</p><h3 id="Unlock-disabled-Apple-account-with-Dr-Fone"><a href="#Unlock-disabled-Apple-account-with-Dr-Fone" class="headerlink" title="Unlock disabled Apple account with Dr. Fone"></a>Unlock disabled Apple account with Dr. Fone</h3><p>The first remedy that can be effectively tested across such situations that involve disabled Apple accounts is relating a third-party platform.

Recognizing the cause of the problem is the first step toward the right fix. Let’s explore the common reasons you might encounter this issue:</p><h3 id="Wrong-Password-Input"><a href="#Wrong-Password-Input" class="headerlink" title="Wrong Password Input"></a>Wrong Password Input</h3><p>One of the most straightforward reasons for a failed verification is entering the wrong password. This could be a simple typing error or misremembering your password. Repeated wrong attempts can also lead to your account being temporarily disabled as a security measure.</p><h3 id="Apple-Server-Issues"><a href="#Apple-Server-Issues" class="headerlink" title="Apple Server Issues"></a>Apple Server Issues</h3><p>At times, the problem may not be on your end. Apple’s servers can experience downtime or technical glitches like any other online service. During such instances, verification processes might fail, as the server cannot authenticate your credentials.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/apple-id-verification-not-working-02.jpg"                      alt="apple server status page"                ></p><h3 id="Slow-Internet-or-Intermittent-Connection"><a href="#Slow-Internet-or-Intermittent-Connection" class="headerlink" title="Slow Internet or Intermittent Connection"></a>Slow Internet or Intermittent Connection</h3><p>A stable and reliable internet connection is improtant for the verification process.

However, it can also be a source of problems. If there’s a delay in receiving the 2FA code or if <a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/android-issue/authentication-error.html"><u>2FA fails to work</u></a>, you won’t be able to complete the verification process. This could be due to network issues or, sometimes, glitches within the 2FA system itself.</p><h3 id="Suspicious-Activity"><a href="#Suspicious-Activity" class="headerlink" title="Suspicious Activity"></a>Suspicious Activity</h3><p>Apple takes your security seriously. If there’s any unusual activity detected on your account, such as login attempts from unfamiliar locations or devices, Apple might lock your account as a precaution.

Due to this, they have added multiple security features, including two-factor authentication. Thus, if you create an Apple ID, you can see a two-factor authentication option that adds an extra layer of security.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/10/remove-two-factor-authentication-1.jpg"                      alt="what is two factor authentication"                ></p><p>2FA is activated when the user provides the password to log into the Apple ID or software through a new device, and it acts as a second layer for account security. Apple ID or any software containing sensitive data cannot be accessed without it. This method provides a higher security level than single-factor authentication. To understand more benefits of this security system in detail, check the following points:</p><ol><li><strong>Protection From Password Theft:</strong> 2FA acts as an additional security level. It protects your accounts and devices in case your password is leaked.</li><li><strong>Migrations of Unauthorized Assets:</strong> Online banking applications use 2FA to protect users from unauthorized bank transfers. If someone accesses their app, this is a beneficial security measure.</li><li><strong>Protection on Multiple Services:</strong> Platforms, including social media, banks, and cloud storage, use 2FA.

However, in some cases, users may want to <strong>remove two-factor authentication iCloud</strong> for multiple reasons. This includes scenarios in which their device is lost or damaged or if they have found a better security option than this one.</p><p>Moreover, there is one important key point to note: Apple has removed the feature of deactivating 2FA from the Apple ID. It means you need to think twice before activating this feature on your Apple ID because it cannot be reversed. For the following reasons, Apple has taken this initiative:</p><ol><li><strong>Enhanced Security:</strong> By removing the deactivation option for 2FA, Apple is trying to strengthen its account security to ensure that no one can access its user’s data.</li><li><strong>Reducing Vulnerabilities:</strong> Allowing users to deactivate 2FA could cause vulnerabilities in the Apple ecosystem that can be a weak point for protecting users’ data. That is why Apple has removed the deactivation option to stop malicious actors from taking advantage of this vulnerability.</li><li><strong>Encouraging Security Awareness:</strong> To make Apple users more security conscious, Apple has made it difficult on purpose to remove 2FA. It helps users to be more confident in Apple services and products.</li><li><strong>Minimizing Mistakenly Steps:</strong> If users mistakenly remove the 2FA, their accounts and devices are at risk of being accessed without proper authentication. To avoid such an issue, the deactivation option of 2FA is removed.</li></ol><p>Besides all these reasons, there is still some good news for those who want to <strong>remove the two-factor authentication iPhone</strong> to use other security options. The good news is that Apple allows users to remove 2FA for a limited time after activation.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-To-Remove-the-Two-Factor-Authentication-Within-14-Days"><a href="#Part-3-How-To-Remove-the-Two-Factor-Authentication-Within-14-Days" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How To Remove the Two-Factor Authentication Within 14 Days"></a>Part 3: How To Remove the Two-Factor Authentication Within 14 Days</h2><p>As explained in the last part, Apple has made removing the 2FA option from Apple ID challenging for several security reasons. Thus, if you want to remove 2FA from your Apple ID, you have only 14 days after activating this feature. To understand <strong>how to disable iCloud two-factor authentication</strong> within this given time, check the following steps:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1.</strong> Once you have activated the 2FA feature, your 14-day grace period will start eventually.

Is “Your account has been disabled in the App Store and iTunes” the same as “This Apple ID has been disabled for security reasons”?</h2><p>There are several instances where you encounter such prompt messages where you are restricted in using the App Store and iTunes. These messages can come in the form of “Your account has been disabled in the App Store and iTunes.” Over observing this prompt message, it has been discovered that the assorted message is not related to the other common message of “This Apple ID has been disabled for security reasons.” The dynamics of getting restricted from using the App Store and iTunes are related to remaining balances that have stuck around for a while over your Apple account.

The Apple iPhone 13 Pro Apple ID will allow you to store and control data available on the Apple iPhone 13 Pro device; however, you need to re-generate the Apple iPhone 13 Pro passcode if you have forgotten the Apple iPhone 13 Pro passcode. Suppose, if you have forgotten the passcode and entered the wrong passcode six times, your Apple iPhone 13 Pro gets locked or has been disabled. According to your settings, if you have entered the wrong passcode too much time could even make your Apple iPhone 13 Pro delete all the data available.</p><p>This article will discuss how you can <strong>unlock Apple ID</strong> and remain secure. If you receive a message that you have entered the wrong passcode or forgotten your passcode, you have to follow some steps to regain access to your Apple Id.</p><h2 id="Why-Is-Your-Apple-ID-Locked-or-Disabled"><a href="#Why-Is-Your-Apple-ID-Locked-or-Disabled" class="headerlink" title="Why Is Your Apple ID Locked or Disabled?"></a>Why Is Your Apple ID Locked or Disabled?</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/03/apple-id-locked.png"                      alt="apple id locked"                ></p><p>Some of the reasons causing your Apple ID locked or disabled are listed below:</p><ul><li>If you have entered the wrong passcode or security question too many times in a row, Apple ID gets locked. (Avoid entering the incorrect password more than 3 times)</li><li>If you haven’t used your Apple ID for an extended period, possibly making your Apple ID disabled or locked. When Apple modifies the requirement for passcode and security questions, you have not updated the information.</li></ul><p>If you frequently change your Apple ID or passcode on the Apple iPhone 13 Pro device, Apple possibly considers that your Apple iPhone 13 Pro faces a security threat and might lock your Apple ID.</p><h2 id="Method-1-Professional-iPhone-Apple-ID-Lock-Removal-Tool-Recommended"><a href="#Method-1-Professional-iPhone-Apple-ID-Lock-Removal-Tool-Recommended" class="headerlink" title="Method 1: Professional iPhone Apple ID Lock Removal Tool [Recommended]"></a>Method 1: Professional iPhone Apple ID Lock Removal Tool [Recommended]</h2><p>If you have forgotten your Apple ID password, you are suggested not to enter the wrong passcode in a row.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="How-to-Fix-Locked-Apple-ID-on-Apple-iPhone-13-Pro"><a href="#How-to-Fix-Locked-Apple-ID-on-Apple-iPhone-13-Pro" class="headerlink" title="How to Fix Locked Apple ID on Apple iPhone 13 Pro"></a>How to Fix Locked Apple ID on Apple iPhone 13 Pro</h2><p>Part of why you own and use Apple devices is the reliability of the Apple iPhone 13 Pro devices and the ease of using them. This starts with the quality of hardware and the synergy with the software that runs the hardware, and the user experience you get. Apple puts great emphasis on this, and rightly so, for this is one of the keys defining and differentiating factors for people to choose Apple’s iOS over Google’s Android. Like with all good things in life, sometimes, a spanner is put in the works that bring your smooth-sailing life to an abrupt halt. With smartphones playing pivotal roles in our lives today, from payments to internet experiences to getting work done to stay in touch with people, anything that stops us from using our smartphone or endangers that experience is a cause for worry. A locked Apple ID is one such thing. It does not happen frequently, in fact, most users will never experience a locked Apple ID, but for the ones who are fortunate enough to have such a rare experience in life, help is at hand. All you need to do is relax and read on. By the end of it, you will have an unlocked Apple ID and you can go back to cruising.</p><h2 id="Part-I-Difference-Between-Activation-Lock-and-Locked-Apple-ID"><a href="#Part-I-Difference-Between-Activation-Lock-and-Locked-Apple-ID" class="headerlink" title="Part I: Difference Between Activation Lock and Locked Apple ID"></a>Part I: Difference Between Activation Lock and Locked Apple ID</h2><p>Apple being Apple, does a lot to make sure that users get the smoothest experience possible when interacting with their Apple products, both hardware, and software. Yet, sometimes, the messaging gets confusing, and people are not sure what is what. One such thing is the difference between iCloud Activation Lock and Apple ID Lock. While people are more likely to encounter Activation Lock and less likely to encounter Apple ID Lock, they are often confused when they encounter Apple ID Lock and struggle to figure out what that means and how to resolve the issue.</p><p>Activation Lock is when your supported Apple device is locked for a number of reasons. The most common reason is a stolen device that was locked by its owner, however, there are other perfectly valid reasons such as an outgoing employee forgetting to sign out and erase their Apple device before submitting it back. The IT department would not be able to reset that device without turning off Find My Apple iPhone 13 Pro and Activation Lock on the Apple iPhone 13 Pro device.</p><p>A locked Apple ID usually happens when the user has forgotten their password to their Apple ID account and attempts to figure out the password have been unsuccessful. Sometimes, Apple ID gets locked automatically under some conditions, and that requires users to reset their password to gain access. A locked Apple ID does not mean that your device is locked for your use. You can keep using it so long as you do not try to use another Apple ID with it since to do that you would have to sign out of your current Apple ID (which is locked) and you won’t be able to do that. On the other hand, Activation Lock renders the entire device unusable till the lock is cleared.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/10/unlock-apple-id-on-iphone-13-3.jpg"                      alt="apple id locked message"                ></p><p>In short, Apple ID Lock is about a user’s account with Apple, akin to how Google Account works on Android devices. Apple ID Lock locks a user’s account with Apple while retaining complete usage of the Apple iPhone 13 Pro device whereas Activation Lock locks the Apple iPhone 13 Pro device and prevents anyone from using it until the correct credentials are entered. This is about verifying the ownership of the Apple iPhone 13 Pro device and works to deter theft of Apple devices.</p><h2 id="Part-II-Checking-If-Your-Apple-ID-Is-Locked"><a href="#Part-II-Checking-If-Your-Apple-ID-Is-Locked" class="headerlink" title="Part II: Checking If Your Apple ID Is Locked"></a>Part II: Checking If Your Apple ID Is Locked</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/10/unlock-apple-id-on-iphone-13-4.jpg"                      alt="the message of apple id locked"                ></p><p>A locked Apple ID is rather unmistakable. Your device would keep telling you that your Apple ID is locked for your security. Your Apple ID could be locked or disabled altogether if someone has tried to gain access to your account (and, obviously, failed). Apple would disable access to the Apple ID unless you are able to prove rightful ownership and reset the password successfully.</p><h2 id="Part-III-Reasons-for-Locked-Apple-ID"><a href="#Part-III-Reasons-for-Locked-Apple-ID" class="headerlink" title="Part III: Reasons for Locked Apple ID"></a>Part III: Reasons for Locked Apple ID</h2><p>There can be a few reasons why your Apple ID is locked. You forgot the password and now it is locked since you entered the wrong password too many times. A scarier prospect, albeit a real one, is that some malicious actor attempted to login into your Apple ID account but failed. Had they succeeded, you would have gotten a message that ‘your Apple ID is being used on another device’ now.</p><p>Apple does a lot to ensure that your Apple ID remains safe. You trust Apple with a lot of your data, including financial data by way of your credit cards associated with Apple ID to make purchases on the App Store and iTunes Store. Therefore, some of the time, Apple preempts issues by proactively locking up your Apple ID or even disabling it. It goes without saying that sometimes it is something so simple as a software error that is believed to have locked up Apple IDs for many users around the world a while ago. It is also entirely possible that it was some malicious actor probing the servers for accounts.</p><p>All of these will result in a locked Apple ID that users will have to reset their password to in order to gain access back.</p><h2 id="Part-IV-How-to-Unlock-Apple-ID-on-Apple-iPhone-13-Pro"><a href="#Part-IV-How-to-Unlock-Apple-ID-on-Apple-iPhone-13-Pro" class="headerlink" title="Part IV: How to Unlock Apple ID on Apple iPhone 13 Pro"></a>Part IV: How to Unlock Apple ID on Apple iPhone 13 Pro</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/10/unlock-apple-id-on-iphone-13-1.jpg"                      alt="apple id webpage"                ></p><p>It is unfortunate you are facing a locked Apple ID. Apple tries its best to make users aware of safety protocols they need to follow to minimize and mitigate such unfortunate occurrences, such as using two-factor authentication, trusted devices, trusted phone numbers, passwords, passcodes, etc. that serve as deterrents to prevent unauthorized access to devices and accounts. Yet, when the unfortunate happens, what to do?</p><h3 id="IV-I-Unlock-Apple-ID-Via-Two-Factor-Authentication"><a href="#IV-I-Unlock-Apple-ID-Via-Two-Factor-Authentication" class="headerlink" title="IV.I: Unlock Apple ID Via Two-Factor Authentication"></a>IV.I: Unlock Apple ID Via Two-Factor Authentication</h3><p>Apple implemented two-factor authentication a long time ago to prevent unauthorized access to Apple ID accounts.

Their style and presentation were not the only reason that made people look forward to buying an iPhone. Apple created its own operating system and presented their own versions of security and protection. One of the most recognized and impeccable features offered by Apple in its innovative structure was the security and safety through Apple ID and Apple Account. Every important feature that operated throughout the Apple iPhone 13 Pro or iPad was focused over a single entity, the Apple ID. However, apart from the Apple ID, there were several other layers of authentications and verifications that were added throughout the protocol structure. A couple of them are renowned as Two Factor Verification and Two Factor Authentication. This article produces a very generous set of advice that should be looked over while handing these layers of protection. To get a better understanding of the procedures involved, you need to look over the guide to gain better knowledge on how to turn off Two Factor Authentication on your Apple.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2020/11/two-factor-authentication-apple.jpg"                      alt="two factor authentication apple"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-Is-two-step-verification-the-same-as-two-factor-authentication"><a href="#Part-1-Is-two-step-verification-the-same-as-two-factor-authentication" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. Is two-step verification the same as two-factor authentication?"></a>Part 1. Is two-step verification the same as two-factor authentication?</h2><p>There might be a few differences involved in these two security models; however, it should be kept in mind that they focus their purpose on securing the Apple ID of the user. Two Factor Verification is a security protocol that protects access to the various activities performed through the Apple ID. It attenuates an extra verification step across the Apple iPhone 13 Pro device in addition to the password for the Apple ID. The device receives a verification code from an authentication factor that allows the authorities to confirm the credibility of the user.</p><p>The Two Factor Authentication is considered as an upgrade to the Two Factor Verification, which was released two years after the Two Factor Verification, in 2015. This authentication method exempted the offline recovery keys and application-specific passcodes. They added a six-digit authentication code onto the original password and produced an offline, time-dependent code that is to be generated through the Settings of the trusted device of the user. This feature was appended into the iOS 9 and OS X El Capitan with a region-specific target.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-turn-off-two-step-verification"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-turn-off-two-step-verification" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. How to turn off two-step verification?"></a>Part 2. How to turn off two-step verification?</h2><p>As you are aware of the Two-Step Verification process, it is quite easy and typical in configuring. However, when it comes to turning the settings off, it is also a simple and straightforward procedure that can be easily covered by following the steps provided below.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> You are required to open the Apple ID Account web page on your browser and sign in with your Apple ID credentials.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> As you log into the website, access the “Security” section, and tap “Edit” from the options provided on the list.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Tap on the “Two-Step Verification” option and turn it off. Confirm to conclude the process. You may be required to select the new security questions and verify the data of birth in the process. As you would be done with it, an email would be received across your connected address for confirmation.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-turn-off-two-factor-authentication-lower-than-iOS-10-3"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-turn-off-two-factor-authentication-lower-than-iOS-10-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 3. How to turn off two-factor authentication? (lower than iOS 10.3)"></a>Part 3. How to turn off two-factor authentication? (lower than iOS 10.3)</h2><p>Two Factor Authentication cannot be turned off in a few cases and accounts for iOS versions greater than 10.3. However, if you have activated Two Factor Authentication across the iOS versions lower than 10.3, you can deactivate the feature through a series of simple steps. The exemption of this security feature across your device leaves it protected only through a password and a few security questions. For turning off the Two Factor Authentication from your Apple device, you need to follow the steps provided as follows:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open your browser and access your Apple ID Account website. Provide the details of your Apple ID and log in.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Tap on “Edit” in the “Security” section and turn off the “Two Factor Authentication” option.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> This would lead you to set new security questions for the Apple ID account, followed by a verification of your date of birth. The successful execution of the process would lead to turning it off.</p><h2 id="Part-4-Why-can’t-you-turn-off-two-factor-authentication-if-you-already-use-it-iOS-10-3-and-later"><a href="#Part-4-Why-can’t-you-turn-off-two-factor-authentication-if-you-already-use-it-iOS-10-3-and-later" class="headerlink" title="Part 4. Why can’t you turn off two-factor authentication if you already use it? (iOS 10.3 and later)"></a>Part 4. Why can’t you turn off two-factor authentication if you already use it? (iOS 10.3 and later)</h2><p>For users who have an Apple device with an iOS 10.3 or later version, they cannot turn the Two Factor Authentication off after it is accessed. The latest iOS and macOS included extra layers of security in their features, which led towards a better security foundation and protection of information. Users who have updated their account information can unenroll in two weeks after updating. For this, you are required to simply access the confirmation email that you have received and tap on the link to approach the previous security settings. Thus, it makes it far more than impossible for users to turn their Two Factor Authentication off if they consider it unnecessary for their device. This feature is something that would always remain intact with their device as an extra layer of security. Its absence does leave a chance of illegal access to the Apple iPhone 13 Pro device and an increased risk of a security breach. Since it is directly built across the Apple iPhone 13 Pro device and its settings, this makes it a very hard-to-approach characteristic.</p><h2 id="Part-5-How-to-turn-off-two-factor-authentication-by-removing-Apple-ID"><a href="#Part-5-How-to-turn-off-two-factor-authentication-by-removing-Apple-ID" class="headerlink" title="Part 5.

How to turn off two-factor authentication by removing Apple ID</h2><p>Users who are very reluctant to remove the two-factor authentication off their device can consider removing the Apple ID itself for fulfilling the purpose.

How to Fix"></a>Why Apple Account Disabled On your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max? How to Fix</h2><p>Apple is one of the leading smartphone developing enterprises that has introduced the world to a contemporary set of features that are not common among other leading smartphone companies. One of the major distinguishing characteristics of Apple has been displayed in its present security protocols. Apple Account is regarded as one of the most significant credentials of the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max and iPad that is responsible for connecting and holding the applications and the assorted data. Many users have generally reported unusual situations that got their Apple Account disabled. There are several reasons that can be associated with the Apple account getting disabled. The major repercussion that is associated with it is unnecessary data loss following the suspension of all products that have been bought with the account over time. This article provides you an impressive overview of the major reasons that lead to your Apple Account getting disabled, followed by the associated mechanisms that can be tested to secure the account.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Why-is-the-Apple-account-disabled"><a href="#Part-1-Why-is-the-Apple-account-disabled" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. Why is the Apple account disabled?"></a>Part 1. Why is the Apple account disabled?</h2><p>Apple iPhone, iPad, and other devices operate over a single Operating System, with its own protocols and unique mechanisms that distinguish it from other smartphone models in the market. Apple believes in securing the data and identification of its users with its state-of-the-art security measures. Under such circumstances, it usually gets possible for the user to have his Apple account disabled unnecessarily. Whenever you encounter such a situation, there are several messages that might be displayed on your device to prompt you over the disabling of the account. These messages usually appear in situations where you intend to sign in to some platform with your associated Apple ID. The most common messages that appear on the screen are:</p><ul><li>“This Apple ID has been disabled for security reasons.”</li><li>“You can’t sign in because your account was disabled for security reasons.”</li><li>“This Apple ID has been locked for security reasons.”</li></ul><p>The messages that have been stated above are usually depicting a security anomaly that led to the disabling of the associated Apple ID. However, there can be several reasons that would have led to such circumstances, which are described as follows.</p><ul><li>There might be incorrect forced logging in into your Apple ID for multiple tries.</li><li>Any user would have entered incorrect security questions multiple times.</li><li>The other information associated with the Apple ID would have been entered incorrectly numerous times.</li></ul><h2 id="Part-2-Is-“Your-account-has-been-disabled-in-the-App-Store-and-iTunes”-the-same-as-“This-Apple-ID-has-been-disabled-for-security-reasons”"><a href="#Part-2-Is-“Your-account-has-been-disabled-in-the-App-Store-and-iTunes”-the-same-as-“This-Apple-ID-has-been-disabled-for-security-reasons”" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

Is “Your account has been disabled in the App Store and iTunes” the same as “This Apple ID has been disabled for security reasons”?</h2><p>There are several instances where you encounter such prompt messages where you are restricted in using the App Store and iTunes. These messages can come in the form of “Your account has been disabled in the App Store and iTunes.” Over observing this prompt message, it has been discovered that the assorted message is not related to the other common message of “This Apple ID has been disabled for security reasons.” The dynamics of getting restricted from using the App Store and iTunes are related to remaining balances that have stuck around for a while over your Apple account. Normally, you may have some billing issues that are prevailing over an unpaid iTunes or App Store order. This problem can be countered through simplistic methods under such conditions where you are having access to the account information and can check for the basic billing information or update the payment method following other settings that are associated with paying bills. Over failure in accessing your account, you are required to contact Apple Support and look for the billing and payment statements to clear up all the remaining dues. Apple has considered covering all the security protocols to perfection, where you have any prevailing Apple charges on your connected credit card that would lead to direct disabling of your Apple Account.</p><p>Even though Apple accounts can be generally disabled overpayment issues, there are several security reasons that might restrict you in discovering and buying different products across the App Store and iTunes. It is necessary for you, as an Apple user, to remain prompt of all the issues that are relating to your Apple Account.</p><h2 id="Part-3-2-tips-to-Unlock-Disabled-Apple-Account"><a href="#Part-3-2-tips-to-Unlock-Disabled-Apple-Account" class="headerlink" title="Part 3. 2 tips to Unlock Disabled Apple Account"></a>Part 3. 2 tips to Unlock Disabled Apple Account</h2><p>As this article provides you a detailed overview of the reasons that lead to your Apple Account getting disabled, this article also considers providing you a few tips and tricks that would guide you in efficiently unlocking your Apple Account and use it with ease.</p><h3 id="Unlock-disabled-Apple-account-with-Dr-Fone"><a href="#Unlock-disabled-Apple-account-with-Dr-Fone" class="headerlink" title="Unlock disabled Apple account with Dr. Fone"></a>Unlock disabled Apple account with Dr. Fone</h3><p>The first remedy that can be effectively tested across such situations that involve disabled Apple accounts is relating a third-party platform.

This starts with the quality of hardware and the synergy with the software that runs the hardware, and the user experience you get. Apple puts great emphasis on this, and rightly so, for this is one of the keys defining and differentiating factors for people to choose Apple’s iOS over Google’s Android. Like with all good things in life, sometimes, a spanner is put in the works that bring your smooth-sailing life to an abrupt halt. With smartphones playing pivotal roles in our lives today, from payments to internet experiences to getting work done to stay in touch with people, anything that stops us from using our smartphone or endangers that experience is a cause for worry. A locked Apple ID is one such thing. It does not happen frequently, in fact, most users will never experience a locked Apple ID, but for the ones who are fortunate enough to have such a rare experience in life, help is at hand. All you need to do is relax and read on. By the end of it, you will have an unlocked Apple ID and you can go back to cruising.</p><h2 id="Part-I-Difference-Between-Activation-Lock-and-Locked-Apple-ID"><a href="#Part-I-Difference-Between-Activation-Lock-and-Locked-Apple-ID" class="headerlink" title="Part I: Difference Between Activation Lock and Locked Apple ID"></a>Part I: Difference Between Activation Lock and Locked Apple ID</h2><p>Apple being Apple, does a lot to make sure that users get the smoothest experience possible when interacting with their Apple products, both hardware, and software. Yet, sometimes, the messaging gets confusing, and people are not sure what is what. One such thing is the difference between iCloud Activation Lock and Apple ID Lock. While people are more likely to encounter Activation Lock and less likely to encounter Apple ID Lock, they are often confused when they encounter Apple ID Lock and struggle to figure out what that means and how to resolve the issue.</p><p>Activation Lock is when your supported Apple device is locked for a number of reasons. The most common reason is a stolen device that was locked by its owner, however, there are other perfectly valid reasons such as an outgoing employee forgetting to sign out and erase their Apple device before submitting it back. The IT department would not be able to reset that device without turning off Find My Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max and Activation Lock on the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device.</p><p>A locked Apple ID usually happens when the user has forgotten their password to their Apple ID account and attempts to figure out the password have been unsuccessful. Sometimes, Apple ID gets locked automatically under some conditions, and that requires users to reset their password to gain access. A locked Apple ID does not mean that your device is locked for your use. You can keep using it so long as you do not try to use another Apple ID with it since to do that you would have to sign out of your current Apple ID (which is locked) and you won’t be able to do that. On the other hand, Activation Lock renders the entire device unusable till the lock is cleared.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/10/unlock-apple-id-on-iphone-13-3.jpg"                      alt="apple id locked message"                ></p><p>In short, Apple ID Lock is about a user’s account with Apple, akin to how Google Account works on Android devices. Apple ID Lock locks a user’s account with Apple while retaining complete usage of the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device whereas Activation Lock locks the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device and prevents anyone from using it until the correct credentials are entered. This is about verifying the ownership of the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device and works to deter theft of Apple devices.</p><h2 id="Part-II-Checking-If-Your-Apple-ID-Is-Locked"><a href="#Part-II-Checking-If-Your-Apple-ID-Is-Locked" class="headerlink" title="Part II: Checking If Your Apple ID Is Locked"></a>Part II: Checking If Your Apple ID Is Locked</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/10/unlock-apple-id-on-iphone-13-4.jpg"                      alt="the message of apple id locked"                ></p><p>A locked Apple ID is rather unmistakable. Your device would keep telling you that your Apple ID is locked for your security. Your Apple ID could be locked or disabled altogether if someone has tried to gain access to your account (and, obviously, failed). Apple would disable access to the Apple ID unless you are able to prove rightful ownership and reset the password successfully.</p><h2 id="Part-III-Reasons-for-Locked-Apple-ID"><a href="#Part-III-Reasons-for-Locked-Apple-ID" class="headerlink" title="Part III: Reasons for Locked Apple ID"></a>Part III: Reasons for Locked Apple ID</h2><p>There can be a few reasons why your Apple ID is locked. You forgot the password and now it is locked since you entered the wrong password too many times. A scarier prospect, albeit a real one, is that some malicious actor attempted to login into your Apple ID account but failed. Had they succeeded, you would have gotten a message that ‘your Apple ID is being used on another device’ now.</p><p>Apple does a lot to ensure that your Apple ID remains safe. You trust Apple with a lot of your data, including financial data by way of your credit cards associated with Apple ID to make purchases on the App Store and iTunes Store. Therefore, some of the time, Apple preempts issues by proactively locking up your Apple ID or even disabling it. It goes without saying that sometimes it is something so simple as a software error that is believed to have locked up Apple IDs for many users around the world a while ago. It is also entirely possible that it was some malicious actor probing the servers for accounts.</p><p>All of these will result in a locked Apple ID that users will have to reset their password to in order to gain access back.</p><h2 id="Part-IV-How-to-Unlock-Apple-ID-on-Apple-iPhone-15-Pro-Max"><a href="#Part-IV-How-to-Unlock-Apple-ID-on-Apple-iPhone-15-Pro-Max" class="headerlink" title="Part IV: How to Unlock Apple ID on Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max"></a>Part IV: How to Unlock Apple ID on Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/10/unlock-apple-id-on-iphone-13-1.jpg"                      alt="apple id webpage"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="2135472">                    <video width="864" height="1536" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/2135472.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2135472">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/2135472.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:540px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Funicoeye.pxf.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F2135472%2F18498'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2135472/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>It is unfortunate you are facing a locked Apple ID.

They have developed an impressive, interconnected model that helps the user keep the data intact across the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device. With unique identification protocols to keep the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device safe from illegal access, Apple provides its user with its own cloud backup platform. iCloud offers Apple users a unique platform with the ability to synchronize and back their data up. This helps the users keep a duplicate in places where they accidentally lose their important data. However, if you have stopped using an Apple device that had an activated iCloud backup system, you may find it necessary to remove the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device from the iCloud account.

The removal of the Find My service makes it possible for thieves to wipe off data of the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device and have it sold across the market, with no chances of retrieval.
