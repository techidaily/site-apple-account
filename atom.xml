This starts with the quality of hardware and the synergy with the software that runs the hardware, and the user experience you get. Apple puts great emphasis on this, and rightly so, for this is one of the keys defining and differentiating factors for people to choose Apple’s iOS over Google’s Android. Like with all good things in life, sometimes, a spanner is put in the works that bring your smooth-sailing life to an abrupt halt. With smartphones playing pivotal roles in our lives today, from payments to internet experiences to getting work done to stay in touch with people, anything that stops us from using our smartphone or endangers that experience is a cause for worry. A locked Apple ID is one such thing. It does not happen frequently, in fact, most users will never experience a locked Apple ID, but for the ones who are fortunate enough to have such a rare experience in life, help is at hand. All you need to do is relax and read on. By the end of it, you will have an unlocked Apple ID and you can go back to cruising.</p><h2 id="Part-I-Difference-Between-Activation-Lock-and-Locked-Apple-ID"><a href="#Part-I-Difference-Between-Activation-Lock-and-Locked-Apple-ID" class="headerlink" title="Part I: Difference Between Activation Lock and Locked Apple ID"></a>Part I: Difference Between Activation Lock and Locked Apple ID</h2><p>Apple being Apple, does a lot to make sure that users get the smoothest experience possible when interacting with their Apple products, both hardware, and software. Yet, sometimes, the messaging gets confusing, and people are not sure what is what. One such thing is the difference between iCloud Activation Lock and Apple ID Lock. While people are more likely to encounter Activation Lock and less likely to encounter Apple ID Lock, they are often confused when they encounter Apple ID Lock and struggle to figure out what that means and how to resolve the issue.</p><p>Activation Lock is when your supported Apple device is locked for a number of reasons. The most common reason is a stolen device that was locked by its owner, however, there are other perfectly valid reasons such as an outgoing employee forgetting to sign out and erase their Apple device before submitting it back. The IT department would not be able to reset that device without turning off Find My Apple iPhone 15 and Activation Lock on the Apple iPhone 15 device.</p><p>A locked Apple ID usually happens when the user has forgotten their password to their Apple ID account and attempts to figure out the password have been unsuccessful. Sometimes, Apple ID gets locked automatically under some conditions, and that requires users to reset their password to gain access. A locked Apple ID does not mean that your device is locked for your use. You can keep using it so long as you do not try to use another Apple ID with it since to do that you would have to sign out of your current Apple ID (which is locked) and you won’t be able to do that. On the other hand, Activation Lock renders the entire device unusable till the lock is cleared.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/10/unlock-apple-id-on-iphone-13-3.jpg"                      alt="apple id locked message"                ></p><p>In short, Apple ID Lock is about a user’s account with Apple, akin to how Google Account works on Android devices. Apple ID Lock locks a user’s account with Apple while retaining complete usage of the Apple iPhone 15 device whereas Activation Lock locks the Apple iPhone 15 device and prevents anyone from using it until the correct credentials are entered. This is about verifying the ownership of the Apple iPhone 15 device and works to deter theft of Apple devices.</p><h2 id="Part-II-Checking-If-Your-Apple-ID-Is-Locked"><a href="#Part-II-Checking-If-Your-Apple-ID-Is-Locked" class="headerlink" title="Part II: Checking If Your Apple ID Is Locked"></a>Part II: Checking If Your Apple ID Is Locked</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/10/unlock-apple-id-on-iphone-13-4.jpg"                      alt="the message of apple id locked"                ></p><p>A locked Apple ID is rather unmistakable. Your device would keep telling you that your Apple ID is locked for your security. Your Apple ID could be locked or disabled altogether if someone has tried to gain access to your account (and, obviously, failed). Apple would disable access to the Apple ID unless you are able to prove rightful ownership and reset the password successfully.</p><h2 id="Part-III-Reasons-for-Locked-Apple-ID"><a href="#Part-III-Reasons-for-Locked-Apple-ID" class="headerlink" title="Part III: Reasons for Locked Apple ID"></a>Part III: Reasons for Locked Apple ID</h2><p>There can be a few reasons why your Apple ID is locked. You forgot the password and now it is locked since you entered the wrong password too many times. A scarier prospect, albeit a real one, is that some malicious actor attempted to login into your Apple ID account but failed. Had they succeeded, you would have gotten a message that ‘your Apple ID is being used on another device’ now.</p><p>Apple does a lot to ensure that your Apple ID remains safe. You trust Apple with a lot of your data, including financial data by way of your credit cards associated with Apple ID to make purchases on the App Store and iTunes Store. Therefore, some of the time, Apple preempts issues by proactively locking up your Apple ID or even disabling it. It goes without saying that sometimes it is something so simple as a software error that is believed to have locked up Apple IDs for many users around the world a while ago. It is also entirely possible that it was some malicious actor probing the servers for accounts.</p><p>All of these will result in a locked Apple ID that users will have to reset their password to in order to gain access back.</p><h2 id="Part-IV-How-to-Unlock-Apple-ID-on-Apple-iPhone-15"><a href="#Part-IV-How-to-Unlock-Apple-ID-on-Apple-iPhone-15" class="headerlink" title="Part IV: How to Unlock Apple ID on Apple iPhone 15"></a>Part IV: How to Unlock Apple ID on Apple iPhone 15</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/10/unlock-apple-id-on-iphone-13-1.jpg"                      alt="apple id webpage"                ></p><p>It is unfortunate you are facing a locked Apple ID. Apple tries its best to make users aware of safety protocols they need to follow to minimize and mitigate such unfortunate occurrences, such as using two-factor authentication, trusted devices, trusted phone numbers, passwords, passcodes, etc. that serve as deterrents to prevent unauthorized access to devices and accounts.

It becomes impossible to view your files on iCloud or to download anything from App store or iTunes if you forgot Apple ID password. Well luckily, you are not the first person to forget Apple ID or <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/reset-iphone/how-to-reset-iphone-password.html" >forgot iPhone password <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.

Here is a quick checklist you should review before subjecting yourself to a meaningless hassle:</p><ol><li>Turn off your Caps Lock as you type in your password unless you have uppercase letters in your password of course.</li><li>If you have more than one email address, you could sometimes get them mixed up so review the email you are using to sign in. You could also have made a spelling mistake in your email address.</li><li>Lastly, your sign in attempts may be fruitless because your account has been disabled for security reasons. In this case you should receive a notification asking you to reset your password so go over your emails.</li></ol><p>If none of the above solutions work, you can safely conclude that you forgot Apple ID password but not to worry, we’ve has got you covered.

How to Fix"></a>Why Apple Account Disabled On your Apple iPhone 15? How to Fix</h2><p>Apple is one of the leading smartphone developing enterprises that has introduced the world to a contemporary set of features that are not common among other leading smartphone companies. One of the major distinguishing characteristics of Apple has been displayed in its present security protocols. Apple Account is regarded as one of the most significant credentials of the Apple iPhone 15 and iPad that is responsible for connecting and holding the applications and the assorted data. Many users have generally reported unusual situations that got their Apple Account disabled. There are several reasons that can be associated with the Apple account getting disabled. The major repercussion that is associated with it is unnecessary data loss following the suspension of all products that have been bought with the account over time. This article provides you an impressive overview of the major reasons that lead to your Apple Account getting disabled, followed by the associated mechanisms that can be tested to secure the account.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Why-is-the-Apple-account-disabled"><a href="#Part-1-Why-is-the-Apple-account-disabled" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. Why is the Apple account disabled?"></a>Part 1. Why is the Apple account disabled?</h2><p>Apple iPhone, iPad, and other devices operate over a single Operating System, with its own protocols and unique mechanisms that distinguish it from other smartphone models in the market. Apple believes in securing the data and identification of its users with its state-of-the-art security measures. Under such circumstances, it usually gets possible for the user to have his Apple account disabled unnecessarily. Whenever you encounter such a situation, there are several messages that might be displayed on your device to prompt you over the disabling of the account. These messages usually appear in situations where you intend to sign in to some platform with your associated Apple ID. The most common messages that appear on the screen are:</p><ul><li>“This Apple ID has been disabled for security reasons.”</li><li>“You can’t sign in because your account was disabled for security reasons.”</li><li>“This Apple ID has been locked for security reasons.”</li></ul><p>The messages that have been stated above are usually depicting a security anomaly that led to the disabling of the associated Apple ID. However, there can be several reasons that would have led to such circumstances, which are described as follows.</p><ul><li>There might be incorrect forced logging in into your Apple ID for multiple tries.</li><li>Any user would have entered incorrect security questions multiple times.</li><li>The other information associated with the Apple ID would have been entered incorrectly numerous times.</li></ul><h2 id="Part-2-Is-“Your-account-has-been-disabled-in-the-App-Store-and-iTunes”-the-same-as-“This-Apple-ID-has-been-disabled-for-security-reasons”"><a href="#Part-2-Is-“Your-account-has-been-disabled-in-the-App-Store-and-iTunes”-the-same-as-“This-Apple-ID-has-been-disabled-for-security-reasons”" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

Is “Your account has been disabled in the App Store and iTunes” the same as “This Apple ID has been disabled for security reasons”?</h2><p>There are several instances where you encounter such prompt messages where you are restricted in using the App Store and iTunes. These messages can come in the form of “Your account has been disabled in the App Store and iTunes.” Over observing this prompt message, it has been discovered that the assorted message is not related to the other common message of “This Apple ID has been disabled for security reasons.” The dynamics of getting restricted from using the App Store and iTunes are related to remaining balances that have stuck around for a while over your Apple account. Normally, you may have some billing issues that are prevailing over an unpaid iTunes or App Store order. This problem can be countered through simplistic methods under such conditions where you are having access to the account information and can check for the basic billing information or update the payment method following other settings that are associated with paying bills. Over failure in accessing your account, you are required to contact Apple Support and look for the billing and payment statements to clear up all the remaining dues. Apple has considered covering all the security protocols to perfection, where you have any prevailing Apple charges on your connected credit card that would lead to direct disabling of your Apple Account.</p><p>Even though Apple accounts can be generally disabled overpayment issues, there are several security reasons that might restrict you in discovering and buying different products across the App Store and iTunes.

Recognizing the cause of the problem is the first step toward the right fix. Let’s explore the common reasons you might encounter this issue:</p><h3 id="Wrong-Password-Input"><a href="#Wrong-Password-Input" class="headerlink" title="Wrong Password Input"></a>Wrong Password Input</h3><p>One of the most straightforward reasons for a failed verification is entering the wrong password. This could be a simple typing error or misremembering your password. Repeated wrong attempts can also lead to your account being temporarily disabled as a security measure.</p><h3 id="Apple-Server-Issues"><a href="#Apple-Server-Issues" class="headerlink" title="Apple Server Issues"></a>Apple Server Issues</h3><p>At times, the problem may not be on your end. Apple’s servers can experience downtime or technical glitches like any other online service. During such instances, verification processes might fail, as the server cannot authenticate your credentials.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/apple-id-verification-not-working-02.jpg"                      alt="apple server status page"                ></p><h3 id="Slow-Internet-or-Intermittent-Connection"><a href="#Slow-Internet-or-Intermittent-Connection" class="headerlink" title="Slow Internet or Intermittent Connection"></a>Slow Internet or Intermittent Connection</h3><p>A stable and reliable internet connection is improtant for the verification process.

However, it can also be a source of problems. If there’s a delay in receiving the 2FA code or if <a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/android-issue/authentication-error.html"><u>2FA fails to work</u></a>, you won’t be able to complete the verification process. This could be due to network issues or, sometimes, glitches within the 2FA system itself.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2075475/7443" target="_top" id="2075475"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2075475"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2075475/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Suspicious-Activity"><a href="#Suspicious-Activity" class="headerlink" title="Suspicious Activity"></a>Suspicious Activity</h3><p>Apple takes your security seriously.

Their style and presentation were not the only reason that made people look forward to buying an iPhone. Apple created its own operating system and presented their own versions of security and protection. One of the most recognized and impeccable features offered by Apple in its innovative structure was the security and safety through Apple ID and Apple Account. Every important feature that operated throughout the Apple iPhone 15 or iPad was focused over a single entity, the Apple ID. However, apart from the Apple ID, there were several other layers of authentications and verifications that were added throughout the protocol structure. A couple of them are renowned as Two Factor Verification and Two Factor Authentication. This article produces a very generous set of advice that should be looked over while handing these layers of protection. To get a better understanding of the procedures involved, you need to look over the guide to gain better knowledge on how to turn off Two Factor Authentication on your Apple.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2020/11/two-factor-authentication-apple.jpg"                      alt="two factor authentication apple"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://ursime.pxf.io/c/5597632/2092236/16384" target="_top" id="2092236"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16384-2092236"                      border="0" alt="" width="1920" height="329"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2092236/16384"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-1-Is-two-step-verification-the-same-as-two-factor-authentication"><a href="#Part-1-Is-two-step-verification-the-same-as-two-factor-authentication" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. Is two-step verification the same as two-factor authentication?"></a>Part 1. Is two-step verification the same as two-factor authentication?</h2><p>There might be a few differences involved in these two security models; however, it should be kept in mind that they focus their purpose on securing the Apple ID of the user. Two Factor Verification is a security protocol that protects access to the various activities performed through the Apple ID. It attenuates an extra verification step across the Apple iPhone 15 device in addition to the password for the Apple ID. The device receives a verification code from an authentication factor that allows the authorities to confirm the credibility of the user.</p><p>The Two Factor Authentication is considered as an upgrade to the Two Factor Verification, which was released two years after the Two Factor Verification, in 2015. This authentication method exempted the offline recovery keys and application-specific passcodes. They added a six-digit authentication code onto the original password and produced an offline, time-dependent code that is to be generated through the Settings of the trusted device of the user. This feature was appended into the iOS 9 and OS X El Capitan with a region-specific target.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-turn-off-two-step-verification"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-turn-off-two-step-verification" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. How to turn off two-step verification?"></a>Part 2. How to turn off two-step verification?</h2><p>As you are aware of the Two-Step Verification process, it is quite easy and typical in configuring. However, when it comes to turning the settings off, it is also a simple and straightforward procedure that can be easily covered by following the steps provided below.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> You are required to open the Apple ID Account web page on your browser and sign in with your Apple ID credentials.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> As you log into the website, access the “Security” section, and tap “Edit” from the options provided on the list.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Tap on the “Two-Step Verification” option and turn it off. Confirm to conclude the process. You may be required to select the new security questions and verify the data of birth in the process. As you would be done with it, an email would be received across your connected address for confirmation.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-turn-off-two-factor-authentication-lower-than-iOS-10-3"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-turn-off-two-factor-authentication-lower-than-iOS-10-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 3. How to turn off two-factor authentication? (lower than iOS 10.3)"></a>Part 3. How to turn off two-factor authentication? (lower than iOS 10.3)</h2><p>Two Factor Authentication cannot be turned off in a few cases and accounts for iOS versions greater than 10.3. However, if you have activated Two Factor Authentication across the iOS versions lower than 10.3, you can deactivate the feature through a series of simple steps. The exemption of this security feature across your device leaves it protected only through a password and a few security questions. For turning off the Two Factor Authentication from your Apple device, you need to follow the steps provided as follows:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open your browser and access your Apple ID Account website. Provide the details of your Apple ID and log in.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Tap on “Edit” in the “Security” section and turn off the “Two Factor Authentication” option.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> This would lead you to set new security questions for the Apple ID account, followed by a verification of your date of birth. The successful execution of the process would lead to turning it off.</p><h2 id="Part-4-Why-can’t-you-turn-off-two-factor-authentication-if-you-already-use-it-iOS-10-3-and-later"><a href="#Part-4-Why-can’t-you-turn-off-two-factor-authentication-if-you-already-use-it-iOS-10-3-and-later" class="headerlink" title="Part 4. Why can’t you turn off two-factor authentication if you already use it? (iOS 10.3 and later)"></a>Part 4. Why can’t you turn off two-factor authentication if you already use it? (iOS 10.3 and later)</h2><p>For users who have an Apple device with an iOS 10.3 or later version, they cannot turn the Two Factor Authentication off after it is accessed. The latest iOS and macOS included extra layers of security in their features, which led towards a better security foundation and protection of information. Users who have updated their account information can unenroll in two weeks after updating. For this, you are required to simply access the confirmation email that you have received and tap on the link to approach the previous security settings. Thus, it makes it far more than impossible for users to turn their Two Factor Authentication off if they consider it unnecessary for their device. This feature is something that would always remain intact with their device as an extra layer of security. Its absence does leave a chance of illegal access to the Apple iPhone 15 device and an increased risk of a security breach. Since it is directly built across the Apple iPhone 15 device and its settings, this makes it a very hard-to-approach characteristic.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://funwhole.sjv.io/c/5597632/1702887/17189" target="_top" id="1702887"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17189-1702887"                      border="0" alt="" width="1000" height="1000"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1702887/17189"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-5-How-to-turn-off-two-factor-authentication-by-removing-Apple-ID"><a href="#Part-5-How-to-turn-off-two-factor-authentication-by-removing-Apple-ID" class="headerlink" title="Part 5.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="How-to-Fix-Locked-Apple-ID-on-Apple-iPhone-15"><a href="#How-to-Fix-Locked-Apple-ID-on-Apple-iPhone-15" class="headerlink" title="How to Fix Locked Apple ID on Apple iPhone 15"></a>How to Fix Locked Apple ID on Apple iPhone 15</h2><p>Part of why you own and use Apple devices is the reliability of the Apple iPhone 15 devices and the ease of using them. This starts with the quality of hardware and the synergy with the software that runs the hardware, and the user experience you get. Apple puts great emphasis on this, and rightly so, for this is one of the keys defining and differentiating factors for people to choose Apple’s iOS over Google’s Android. Like with all good things in life, sometimes, a spanner is put in the works that bring your smooth-sailing life to an abrupt halt. With smartphones playing pivotal roles in our lives today, from payments to internet experiences to getting work done to stay in touch with people, anything that stops us from using our smartphone or endangers that experience is a cause for worry. A locked Apple ID is one such thing. It does not happen frequently, in fact, most users will never experience a locked Apple ID, but for the ones who are fortunate enough to have such a rare experience in life, help is at hand. All you need to do is relax and read on. By the end of it, you will have an unlocked Apple ID and you can go back to cruising.</p><h2 id="Part-I-Difference-Between-Activation-Lock-and-Locked-Apple-ID"><a href="#Part-I-Difference-Between-Activation-Lock-and-Locked-Apple-ID" class="headerlink" title="Part I: Difference Between Activation Lock and Locked Apple ID"></a>Part I: Difference Between Activation Lock and Locked Apple ID</h2><p>Apple being Apple, does a lot to make sure that users get the smoothest experience possible when interacting with their Apple products, both hardware, and software. Yet, sometimes, the messaging gets confusing, and people are not sure what is what. One such thing is the difference between iCloud Activation Lock and Apple ID Lock. While people are more likely to encounter Activation Lock and less likely to encounter Apple ID Lock, they are often confused when they encounter Apple ID Lock and struggle to figure out what that means and how to resolve the issue.</p><p>Activation Lock is when your supported Apple device is locked for a number of reasons. The most common reason is a stolen device that was locked by its owner, however, there are other perfectly valid reasons such as an outgoing employee forgetting to sign out and erase their Apple device before submitting it back. The IT department would not be able to reset that device without turning off Find My Apple iPhone 15 and Activation Lock on the Apple iPhone 15 device.</p><p>A locked Apple ID usually happens when the user has forgotten their password to their Apple ID account and attempts to figure out the password have been unsuccessful. Sometimes, Apple ID gets locked automatically under some conditions, and that requires users to reset their password to gain access. A locked Apple ID does not mean that your device is locked for your use. You can keep using it so long as you do not try to use another Apple ID with it since to do that you would have to sign out of your current Apple ID (which is locked) and you won’t be able to do that. On the other hand, Activation Lock renders the entire device unusable till the lock is cleared.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/10/unlock-apple-id-on-iphone-13-3.jpg"                      alt="apple id locked message"                ></p><p>In short, Apple ID Lock is about a user’s account with Apple, akin to how Google Account works on Android devices. Apple ID Lock locks a user’s account with Apple while retaining complete usage of the Apple iPhone 15 device whereas Activation Lock locks the Apple iPhone 15 device and prevents anyone from using it until the correct credentials are entered. This is about verifying the ownership of the Apple iPhone 15 device and works to deter theft of Apple devices.</p><h2 id="Part-II-Checking-If-Your-Apple-ID-Is-Locked"><a href="#Part-II-Checking-If-Your-Apple-ID-Is-Locked" class="headerlink" title="Part II: Checking If Your Apple ID Is Locked"></a>Part II: Checking If Your Apple ID Is Locked</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/10/unlock-apple-id-on-iphone-13-4.jpg"                      alt="the message of apple id locked"                ></p><p>A locked Apple ID is rather unmistakable. Your device would keep telling you that your Apple ID is locked for your security. Your Apple ID could be locked or disabled altogether if someone has tried to gain access to your account (and, obviously, failed). Apple would disable access to the Apple ID unless you are able to prove rightful ownership and reset the password successfully.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://natural-cycles.sjv.io/c/5597632/2072200/17885" target="_top" id="2072200"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17885-2072200"                      border="0" alt="" width="728" height="90"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2072200/17885"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-III-Reasons-for-Locked-Apple-ID"><a href="#Part-III-Reasons-for-Locked-Apple-ID" class="headerlink" title="Part III: Reasons for Locked Apple ID"></a>Part III: Reasons for Locked Apple ID</h2><p>There can be a few reasons why your Apple ID is locked. You forgot the password and now it is locked since you entered the wrong password too many times. A scarier prospect, albeit a real one, is that some malicious actor attempted to login into your Apple ID account but failed. Had they succeeded, you would have gotten a message that ‘your Apple ID is being used on another device’ now.</p><p>Apple does a lot to ensure that your Apple ID remains safe. You trust Apple with a lot of your data, including financial data by way of your credit cards associated with Apple ID to make purchases on the App Store and iTunes Store. Therefore, some of the time, Apple preempts issues by proactively locking up your Apple ID or even disabling it. It goes without saying that sometimes it is something so simple as a software error that is believed to have locked up Apple IDs for many users around the world a while ago. It is also entirely possible that it was some malicious actor probing the servers for accounts.</p><p>All of these will result in a locked Apple ID that users will have to reset their password to in order to gain access back.</p><h2 id="Part-IV-How-to-Unlock-Apple-ID-on-Apple-iPhone-15"><a href="#Part-IV-How-to-Unlock-Apple-ID-on-Apple-iPhone-15" class="headerlink" title="Part IV: How to Unlock Apple ID on Apple iPhone 15"></a>Part IV: How to Unlock Apple ID on Apple iPhone 15</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/10/unlock-apple-id-on-iphone-13-1.jpg"                      alt="apple id webpage"                ></p><p>It is unfortunate you are facing a locked Apple ID. Apple tries its best to make users aware of safety protocols they need to follow to minimize and mitigate such unfortunate occurrences, such as using two-factor authentication, trusted devices, trusted phone numbers, passwords, passcodes, etc. that serve as deterrents to prevent unauthorized access to devices and accounts. Yet, when the unfortunate happens, what to do?</p><h3 id="IV-I-Unlock-Apple-ID-Via-Two-Factor-Authentication"><a href="#IV-I-Unlock-Apple-ID-Via-Two-Factor-Authentication" class="headerlink" title="IV.I: Unlock Apple ID Via Two-Factor Authentication"></a>IV.I: Unlock Apple ID Via Two-Factor Authentication</h3><p>Apple implemented two-factor authentication a long time ago to prevent unauthorized access to Apple ID accounts.

To get a better understanding of the procedures involved, you need to look over the guide to gain better knowledge on how to turn off Two Factor Authentication on your Apple.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2020/11/two-factor-authentication-apple.jpg"                      alt="two factor authentication apple"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-Is-two-step-verification-the-same-as-two-factor-authentication"><a href="#Part-1-Is-two-step-verification-the-same-as-two-factor-authentication" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. Is two-step verification the same as two-factor authentication?"></a>Part 1. Is two-step verification the same as two-factor authentication?</h2><p>There might be a few differences involved in these two security models; however, it should be kept in mind that they focus their purpose on securing the Apple ID of the user. Two Factor Verification is a security protocol that protects access to the various activities performed through the Apple ID. It attenuates an extra verification step across the Apple iPhone 15 device in addition to the password for the Apple ID. The device receives a verification code from an authentication factor that allows the authorities to confirm the credibility of the user.</p><p>The Two Factor Authentication is considered as an upgrade to the Two Factor Verification, which was released two years after the Two Factor Verification, in 2015. This authentication method exempted the offline recovery keys and application-specific passcodes. They added a six-digit authentication code onto the original password and produced an offline, time-dependent code that is to be generated through the Settings of the trusted device of the user. This feature was appended into the iOS 9 and OS X El Capitan with a region-specific target.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-turn-off-two-step-verification"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-turn-off-two-step-verification" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. How to turn off two-step verification?"></a>Part 2. How to turn off two-step verification?</h2><p>As you are aware of the Two-Step Verification process, it is quite easy and typical in configuring. However, when it comes to turning the settings off, it is also a simple and straightforward procedure that can be easily covered by following the steps provided below.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> You are required to open the Apple ID Account web page on your browser and sign in with your Apple ID credentials.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> As you log into the website, access the “Security” section, and tap “Edit” from the options provided on the list.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Tap on the “Two-Step Verification” option and turn it off. Confirm to conclude the process. You may be required to select the new security questions and verify the data of birth in the process. As you would be done with it, an email would be received across your connected address for confirmation.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-turn-off-two-factor-authentication-lower-than-iOS-10-3"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-turn-off-two-factor-authentication-lower-than-iOS-10-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 3. How to turn off two-factor authentication? (lower than iOS 10.3)"></a>Part 3. How to turn off two-factor authentication? (lower than iOS 10.3)</h2><p>Two Factor Authentication cannot be turned off in a few cases and accounts for iOS versions greater than 10.3. However, if you have activated Two Factor Authentication across the iOS versions lower than 10.3, you can deactivate the feature through a series of simple steps. The exemption of this security feature across your device leaves it protected only through a password and a few security questions. For turning off the Two Factor Authentication from your Apple device, you need to follow the steps provided as follows:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open your browser and access your Apple ID Account website. Provide the details of your Apple ID and log in.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Tap on “Edit” in the “Security” section and turn off the “Two Factor Authentication” option.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> This would lead you to set new security questions for the Apple ID account, followed by a verification of your date of birth. The successful execution of the process would lead to turning it off.</p><h2 id="Part-4-Why-can’t-you-turn-off-two-factor-authentication-if-you-already-use-it-iOS-10-3-and-later"><a href="#Part-4-Why-can’t-you-turn-off-two-factor-authentication-if-you-already-use-it-iOS-10-3-and-later" class="headerlink" title="Part 4. Why can’t you turn off two-factor authentication if you already use it? (iOS 10.3 and later)"></a>Part 4. Why can’t you turn off two-factor authentication if you already use it? (iOS 10.3 and later)</h2><p>For users who have an Apple device with an iOS 10.3 or later version, they cannot turn the Two Factor Authentication off after it is accessed. The latest iOS and macOS included extra layers of security in their features, which led towards a better security foundation and protection of information. Users who have updated their account information can unenroll in two weeks after updating. For this, you are required to simply access the confirmation email that you have received and tap on the link to approach the previous security settings. Thus, it makes it far more than impossible for users to turn their Two Factor Authentication off if they consider it unnecessary for their device. This feature is something that would always remain intact with their device as an extra layer of security. Its absence does leave a chance of illegal access to the Apple iPhone 15 device and an increased risk of a security breach. Since it is directly built across the Apple iPhone 15 device and its settings, this makes it a very hard-to-approach characteristic.</p><h2 id="Part-5-How-to-turn-off-two-factor-authentication-by-removing-Apple-ID"><a href="#Part-5-How-to-turn-off-two-factor-authentication-by-removing-Apple-ID" class="headerlink" title="Part 5. How to turn off two-factor authentication by removing Apple ID"></a>Part 5. How to turn off two-factor authentication by removing Apple ID</h2><p>Users who are very reluctant to remove the two-factor authentication off their device can consider removing the Apple ID itself for fulfilling the purpose. However, when it comes to executing such tasks, the need for a third-party platform gets evident. Third-party platforms provided dedicated services in providing users with a unique platform of operation with an environment that suits their purpose perfectly. Many platforms provide such impressive services, yet the selection gets quite difficult for a series of reasons. The following pointers explain the reasons to the users over why they should focus on selecting a platform such as <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/iphone-unlock/" >Dr. Fone – Screen Unlock (iOS) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for this purpose.</p><ul><li>You need to have no excessive knowledge of handling the platform.</li><li>You can cover all the dynamics of unlocking the Apple iPhone 15 device without the use of iTunes.</li><li>The platform provides you with the ability to unlock the passcode of your Apple device with ease.</li><li>It offers you to protect your device from the disabled state.</li><li>Works across all models of iPhone, iPad, and iPod Touch.</li><li>Provides services to the latest version of iOS.</li></ul><p>Dr. Fone – Screen Unlock (iOS) makes it easy for the users to control and remove their Apple ID and disable the two-factor authentication across their device. However, when it comes to controlling the platform, it follows a few simple and efficient steps that would guide you in executing the task successfully.</p><p><strong>Step 1: Connect your Device and Launch Application</strong></p><p>You need to connect your Apple device with the desktop and launch Dr. Fone across the computer. Tap on the “Screen Unlock” tool present on the home window and proceed with the removal of two-factor authentication.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png"                      alt="drfone home"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2: Access Appropriate Option</strong></p><p>On the next screen that opens, you are required to select “Unlock Apple ID” from the three options. Proceed to your Apple device to take the process further.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/android-screen-unlock-2.png"                      alt="drfone android ios unlock"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3: Trust the Computer</strong></p><p>Open the Apple iPhone 15 device and tap on “Trust” over the prompt that appears on the screen. Following this, you need to navigate to the Settings of your device to initiate a reboot.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/drfone/trust-computer.jpg"                      alt="trust computer"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4: Execution of Process</strong></p><p>Once you are done with initiating a reboot, the platform automatically detects the update in the process and initiates removing the Apple ID from the Apple iPhone 15 device. Once the platform is done with the process, it provides a prompt message in the next window displaying the execution of the removal of Apple ID from your device. This also removes the Two Factor Authentication off your device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/remove-apple-id-8.png"                      alt="complete"                ></p><h2 id="Conclusion-1"><a href="#Conclusion-1" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>The article has presented a very detailed comparison of the Two Factor Verification and Two Factor Authentication and provided an elaborated discussion over how to turn these security features off their devices. The article also discussed a third-party platform that would guide in removing such security features of the Apple iPhone 15 devices over the requirement of the user.

This significance is particularly pronounced within the Apple ecosystem. A pivotal element of this digital identity is the Apple ID verification code. It might appear as a mere sequence of characters, but it carries immense significance. The verification code serves as a safeguard for your Apple account and all the Apple iPhone 15 devices linked to it.</p><p>Whether you’ve been an Apple user for years or are just starting out in the ecosystem, grasping the process of obtaining this code is essential.

It also encompasses a steadfast commitment to security. This commitment is reinforced by the implementation of rigorous security protocols and encryption measures. It understands the critical need to fortify the security of its devices and accounts. One pivotal aspect of Apple’s safety is the use of verification codes. These codes serve as an extra level of protection.</p><p>The basic idea behind verification codes is to require users to provide a temporary code in addition to their regular password. This code is commonly dispatched to a trusted device, such as an iPhone. This is to introduce an additional layer of security that proves challenging for hackers to bypass. Apple users have several methods that will help them in <strong>how to get the Apple ID verification code</strong> scenario**.**</p><h3 id="1-SMS-or-Text-Messages"><a href="#1-SMS-or-Text-Messages" class="headerlink" title="1.

However, after enabling the function, many iPhone users forget to remove it from the FindMy app ahead of time. Therefore, if you are selling or resetting the Apple iPhone 15 device, you need to <strong>remove AirTag from Apple ID</strong> to be usable later.</p><p>If someone removes the AirTag without resetting it while operating in the Bluetooth range, deleting AirTag ownership will require manually breaking the Apple iPhone 15 device apart and further configuration.</p><p>Remove this connection from the Apple ID account with simple steps first-hand to avoid that. Read on to know the steps involved in this process directly or with the best software alternative.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/01/how-to-remove-airtag-from-apple-id-1.jpg"                      alt="remove airtag on iphone"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-Exactly-Does-an-AirTag-Do"><a href="#Part-1-What-Exactly-Does-an-AirTag-Do" class="headerlink" title="Part 1.

What Exactly Does an AirTag Do?</h2><p>Before discussing <strong>how to remove AirTag from Apple ID,</strong> you should know better about the function itself. The AirTag feature is available for iOS devices. Therefore, one can register the AirTag process with the Apple ID you are utilizing on your smartphone.</p><p>Apple users can attach the AirTag to different objects like backpacks or keychains.

If you had set it up for your account, you can use it if you forgot Apple ID password.

Though they are a very secure and effective method of password recovery, you could easily get permanently locked out of your Apple account. When using a recovery key, you initially need:</p><ol><li>An Apple ID password.</li><li>A trusted device that you can easily access.</li><li>The actual Recovery Key.</li></ol><p>Now if you happen to lose any two of the above at the same time, there is no way of recovering your account and you simply have to create a new one.</p><p>Also Read: <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/reset-iphone/factory-reset-iphone-without-passcode.html" >How to Factory Reset iPhone without Passcode &gt;&gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="Part-7-Using-Apple’s-Two-Factor-Authentication-Forgot-Apple-ID-Password"><a href="#Part-7-Using-Apple’s-Two-Factor-Authentication-Forgot-Apple-ID-Password" class="headerlink" title="Part 7: Using Apple’s Two-Factor Authentication (Forgot Apple ID Password)"></a>Part 7: Using Apple’s Two-Factor Authentication (Forgot Apple ID Password)</h2><p>This is a new account recovery option that is built into iOS 9 and OS X El Capitan.

Here’s the step by step guide on how the process works.</p><p><strong>Step 1: Install Dr.Fone on your Computer</strong></p><p>Install the software. Launch it and connect your Apple iPhone 15 to the computer using a USB cable. Choose the “Screen Unlock” option from the menu.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png"                      alt="drfone home"                ></p><p>The interface will present another set of options before you.

You need to tap the “Trust this Computer” option on your phone, and then Dr.Fone will begin to access your device. It would help if you kept in mind that proceeding with this process will wipe all your Apple iPhone 15 data.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/drfone/trust-computer.jpg"                      alt="trust computer"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3: Reset all your Apple iPhone 15 Settings</strong></p><p>Dr.Fone will present a set of instructions for you to follow.

In this case, however, you must remember all the security questions to reset your password successfully. If you don’t remember the security questions, you can also reset the recovery password using the registered e-mail ID.</p><p>Follow these instructions to reset your password and then sign out of the Apple ID.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Go to the <a class="link"   href="https://appleid.apple.com/" >Apple ID Account Page <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and click “<strong>Forgot Apple ID or Password</strong>”.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2020/05/forgot-apple-id-or-password.jpg"                      alt="forgot apple id or password"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Enter your Apple ID and click “<strong>Continue</strong>”. In the next window, select “<strong>I Need to Reset My Password</strong>”.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Now, select the method using which you want to reset the password. Here are the three possible options.</p><ul><li><p>If you’ve set up security questions while creating your Apple ID, you can choose “<strong>Answer Security Questions</strong>”. This method will only work if you remember all the answers to every security question. Once you select this method, you’ll be prompted to a new window, with all security questions. Answer these questions and follow the further instructions to reset your password.</p></li><li><p>If you’ve added a recovery e-mail while creating your Apple ID, you can also use it to reset the password. In this case, select “<strong>Get an E-mail</strong>”. You’ll receive a password reset e-mail on your registered email.</p><p>  <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2020/05/recovery-email.jpg"                      alt="recovery email"                ></p></li><li><p>Whichever recovery method you choose, make sure to follow the on-screen instructions carefully. Once your password reset process completes, you’ll have to individually update the password in every iCloud service, be it iTunes or iMessage.</p></li></ul><p>In case you have enabled two-way verification on your Apple iPhone 15, you’ll receive a different screen after clicking “Forgot Apple ID or Password”. In this case, you’ll have to follow a different approach to reset your Apple ID password.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Go to the Apple ID Account page and click “<strong>Forgot ID or Password</strong>”.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Enter your Apple ID and select the “<strong>Reset Password</strong>” option.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> In the next window, you’ll be asked to enter the “<strong>Recovery Key</strong>”. This is a unique key that is provided when a user enables two-way verification for their iCloud account. Enter the recovery key and click “<strong>Continue</strong>”.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2020/05/enter-recovery-key.jpg"                      alt="enter recovery key"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Choose a trusted device to receive the verification code. Now, enter this verification code and click “<strong>Continue</strong>”.</p><p><strong>Step 5:</strong> In the next window, enter a new password and tap “<strong>Reset Password</strong>”.</p><p>Once you’ve reset the password, you can easily sign out of the Apple ID by navigating through Settings&gt;Apple ID&gt;Sign Out on your Apple iPhone 15.</p><h2 id="Part-5-Sign-Out-of-Apple-ID-without-Password-by-Apple-Support-App"><a href="#Part-5-Sign-Out-of-Apple-ID-without-Password-by-Apple-Support-App" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: Sign Out of Apple ID without Password by Apple Support App"></a>Part 5: Sign Out of Apple ID without Password by Apple Support App</h2><p>If you’re unable to reset your Apple ID password on your own, you can seek assistance from Apple’s official Support app. It provides expert guidance and troubleshooting. Here’s how to use the Apple Support app to sign out of your Apple ID without a password:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Access the Apple Support app on another Apple device.

This starts with the quality of hardware and the synergy with the software that runs the hardware, and the user experience you get. Apple puts great emphasis on this, and rightly so, for this is one of the keys defining and differentiating factors for people to choose Apple’s iOS over Google’s Android. Like with all good things in life, sometimes, a spanner is put in the works that bring your smooth-sailing life to an abrupt halt. With smartphones playing pivotal roles in our lives today, from payments to internet experiences to getting work done to stay in touch with people, anything that stops us from using our smartphone or endangers that experience is a cause for worry. A locked Apple ID is one such thing. It does not happen frequently, in fact, most users will never experience a locked Apple ID, but for the ones who are fortunate enough to have such a rare experience in life, help is at hand. All you need to do is relax and read on. By the end of it, you will have an unlocked Apple ID and you can go back to cruising.</p><h2 id="Part-I-Difference-Between-Activation-Lock-and-Locked-Apple-ID"><a href="#Part-I-Difference-Between-Activation-Lock-and-Locked-Apple-ID" class="headerlink" title="Part I: Difference Between Activation Lock and Locked Apple ID"></a>Part I: Difference Between Activation Lock and Locked Apple ID</h2><p>Apple being Apple, does a lot to make sure that users get the smoothest experience possible when interacting with their Apple products, both hardware, and software. Yet, sometimes, the messaging gets confusing, and people are not sure what is what. One such thing is the difference between iCloud Activation Lock and Apple ID Lock. While people are more likely to encounter Activation Lock and less likely to encounter Apple ID Lock, they are often confused when they encounter Apple ID Lock and struggle to figure out what that means and how to resolve the issue.</p><p>Activation Lock is when your supported Apple device is locked for a number of reasons. The most common reason is a stolen device that was locked by its owner, however, there are other perfectly valid reasons such as an outgoing employee forgetting to sign out and erase their Apple device before submitting it back. The IT department would not be able to reset that device without turning off Find My Apple iPhone 15 and Activation Lock on the Apple iPhone 15 device.</p><p>A locked Apple ID usually happens when the user has forgotten their password to their Apple ID account and attempts to figure out the password have been unsuccessful. Sometimes, Apple ID gets locked automatically under some conditions, and that requires users to reset their password to gain access. A locked Apple ID does not mean that your device is locked for your use. You can keep using it so long as you do not try to use another Apple ID with it since to do that you would have to sign out of your current Apple ID (which is locked) and you won’t be able to do that. On the other hand, Activation Lock renders the entire device unusable till the lock is cleared.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/10/unlock-apple-id-on-iphone-13-3.jpg"                      alt="apple id locked message"                ></p><p>In short, Apple ID Lock is about a user’s account with Apple, akin to how Google Account works on Android devices. Apple ID Lock locks a user’s account with Apple while retaining complete usage of the Apple iPhone 15 device whereas Activation Lock locks the Apple iPhone 15 device and prevents anyone from using it until the correct credentials are entered. This is about verifying the ownership of the Apple iPhone 15 device and works to deter theft of Apple devices.</p><h2 id="Part-II-Checking-If-Your-Apple-ID-Is-Locked"><a href="#Part-II-Checking-If-Your-Apple-ID-Is-Locked" class="headerlink" title="Part II: Checking If Your Apple ID Is Locked"></a>Part II: Checking If Your Apple ID Is Locked</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/10/unlock-apple-id-on-iphone-13-4.jpg"                      alt="the message of apple id locked"                ></p><p>A locked Apple ID is rather unmistakable. Your device would keep telling you that your Apple ID is locked for your security. Your Apple ID could be locked or disabled altogether if someone has tried to gain access to your account (and, obviously, failed). Apple would disable access to the Apple ID unless you are able to prove rightful ownership and reset the password successfully.</p><h2 id="Part-III-Reasons-for-Locked-Apple-ID"><a href="#Part-III-Reasons-for-Locked-Apple-ID" class="headerlink" title="Part III: Reasons for Locked Apple ID"></a>Part III: Reasons for Locked Apple ID</h2><p>There can be a few reasons why your Apple ID is locked. You forgot the password and now it is locked since you entered the wrong password too many times. A scarier prospect, albeit a real one, is that some malicious actor attempted to login into your Apple ID account but failed. Had they succeeded, you would have gotten a message that ‘your Apple ID is being used on another device’ now.</p><p>Apple does a lot to ensure that your Apple ID remains safe. You trust Apple with a lot of your data, including financial data by way of your credit cards associated with Apple ID to make purchases on the App Store and iTunes Store. Therefore, some of the time, Apple preempts issues by proactively locking up your Apple ID or even disabling it. It goes without saying that sometimes it is something so simple as a software error that is believed to have locked up Apple IDs for many users around the world a while ago. It is also entirely possible that it was some malicious actor probing the servers for accounts.</p><p>All of these will result in a locked Apple ID that users will have to reset their password to in order to gain access back.</p><h2 id="Part-IV-How-to-Unlock-Apple-ID-on-Apple-iPhone-15"><a href="#Part-IV-How-to-Unlock-Apple-ID-on-Apple-iPhone-15" class="headerlink" title="Part IV: How to Unlock Apple ID on Apple iPhone 15"></a>Part IV: How to Unlock Apple ID on Apple iPhone 15</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/10/unlock-apple-id-on-iphone-13-1.jpg"                      alt="apple id webpage"                ></p><p>It is unfortunate you are facing a locked Apple ID.

This could be a simple typing error or misremembering your password. Repeated wrong attempts can also lead to your account being temporarily disabled as a security measure.</p><h3 id="Apple-Server-Issues"><a href="#Apple-Server-Issues" class="headerlink" title="Apple Server Issues"></a>Apple Server Issues</h3><p>At times, the problem may not be on your end. Apple’s servers can experience downtime or technical glitches like any other online service. During such instances, verification processes might fail, as the server cannot authenticate your credentials.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/apple-id-verification-not-working-02.jpg"                      alt="apple server status page"                ></p><h3 id="Slow-Internet-or-Intermittent-Connection"><a href="#Slow-Internet-or-Intermittent-Connection" class="headerlink" title="Slow Internet or Intermittent Connection"></a>Slow Internet or Intermittent Connection</h3><p>A stable and reliable internet connection is improtant for the verification process.

However, it can also be a source of problems. If there’s a delay in receiving the 2FA code or if <a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/android-issue/authentication-error.html"><u>2FA fails to work</u></a>, you won’t be able to complete the verification process. This could be due to network issues or, sometimes, glitches within the 2FA system itself.</p><h3 id="Suspicious-Activity"><a href="#Suspicious-Activity" class="headerlink" title="Suspicious Activity"></a>Suspicious Activity</h3><p>Apple takes your security seriously. If there’s any unusual activity detected on your account, such as login attempts from unfamiliar locations or devices, Apple might lock your account as a precaution. This can trigger the verification failed prompt as the system seeks to protect your account from potential unauthorized access.</p><p>By understanding these scenarios, you can diagnose better why you’re facing the issue of <strong>Apple verification ID not working</strong>.

With these innovations, companies like Apple and Google have introduced the two-factor authentication process to protect user data.</p><p>But sometimes, this security method becomes a hassle to access your data daily, due to which many users try to remove it. That is why, in this article, we have discussed how you can <strong>remove iCloud two-factor authentication</strong> easily.</p><ul><li><a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/remove-apple-account/remove-apple-two-factor-authentication.html#Part1" >Part 1: What Is Two-Factor Authentication and How Helpful It Is <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/remove-apple-account/remove-apple-two-factor-authentication.html#Part2" >Part 2: Can You Remove the Two Factor Authentication iCloud at Anytime <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/remove-apple-account/remove-apple-two-factor-authentication.html#Part3" >Part 3: How To Remove the Two-Factor Authentication Within 14 Days <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/remove-apple-account/remove-apple-two-factor-authentication.html#Part4" >Part 4: iPhone Apple ID Got Locked?

Due to this, they have added multiple security features, including two-factor authentication. Thus, if you create an Apple ID, you can see a two-factor authentication option that adds an extra layer of security.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/10/remove-two-factor-authentication-1.jpg"                      alt="what is two factor authentication"                ></p><p>2FA is activated when the user provides the password to log into the Apple ID or software through a new device, and it acts as a second layer for account security. Apple ID or any software containing sensitive data cannot be accessed without it. This method provides a higher security level than single-factor authentication. To understand more benefits of this security system in detail, check the following points:</p><ol><li><strong>Protection From Password Theft:</strong> 2FA acts as an additional security level. It protects your accounts and devices in case your password is leaked.</li><li><strong>Migrations of Unauthorized Assets:</strong> Online banking applications use 2FA to protect users from unauthorized bank transfers. If someone accesses their app, this is a beneficial security measure.</li><li><strong>Protection on Multiple Services:</strong> Platforms, including social media, banks, and cloud storage, use 2FA. It means that 2FA can be used in various digital aspects.</li></ol><h2 id="Part-2-Can-You-Remove-the-Two-Factor-Authentication-iCloud-at-Anytime"><a href="#Part-2-Can-You-Remove-the-Two-Factor-Authentication-iCloud-at-Anytime" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Can You Remove the Two Factor Authentication iCloud at Anytime"></a>Part 2: Can You Remove the Two Factor Authentication iCloud at Anytime</h2><p>Many people use 2FA globally to protect their personal information and devices from hackers and unauthorized access. However, in some cases, users may want to <strong>remove two-factor authentication iCloud</strong> for multiple reasons. This includes scenarios in which their device is lost or damaged or if they have found a better security option than this one.</p><p>Moreover, there is one important key point to note: Apple has removed the feature of deactivating 2FA from the Apple ID. It means you need to think twice before activating this feature on your Apple ID because it cannot be reversed. For the following reasons, Apple has taken this initiative:</p><ol><li><strong>Enhanced Security:</strong> By removing the deactivation option for 2FA, Apple is trying to strengthen its account security to ensure that no one can access its user’s data.</li><li><strong>Reducing Vulnerabilities:</strong> Allowing users to deactivate 2FA could cause vulnerabilities in the Apple ecosystem that can be a weak point for protecting users’ data. That is why Apple has removed the deactivation option to stop malicious actors from taking advantage of this vulnerability.</li><li><strong>Encouraging Security Awareness:</strong> To make Apple users more security conscious, Apple has made it difficult on purpose to remove 2FA. It helps users to be more confident in Apple services and products.</li><li><strong>Minimizing Mistakenly Steps:</strong> If users mistakenly remove the 2FA, their accounts and devices are at risk of being accessed without proper authentication. To avoid such an issue, the deactivation option of 2FA is removed.</li></ol><p>Besides all these reasons, there is still some good news for those who want to <strong>remove the two-factor authentication iPhone</strong> to use other security options. The good news is that Apple allows users to remove 2FA for a limited time after activation.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-To-Remove-the-Two-Factor-Authentication-Within-14-Days"><a href="#Part-3-How-To-Remove-the-Two-Factor-Authentication-Within-14-Days" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How To Remove the Two-Factor Authentication Within 14 Days"></a>Part 3: How To Remove the Two-Factor Authentication Within 14 Days</h2><p>As explained in the last part, Apple has made removing the 2FA option from Apple ID challenging for several security reasons. Thus, if you want to remove 2FA from your Apple ID, you have only 14 days after activating this feature. To understand <strong>how to disable iCloud two-factor authentication</strong> within this given time, check the following steps:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1.</strong> Once you have activated the 2FA feature, your 14-day grace period will start eventually. To deactivate this, open the enrollment email you received from Apple regarding 2FA on your Apple ID.</li><li><strong>Step 2.</strong> Scroll to the bottom of this email and select the link or button to return to your account security &amp; settings section. There, follow the on-screen instructions to deactivate the 2FA of your Apple ID.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/10/remove-two-factor-authentication-2.jpg"                      alt="deactivate two factor authentication"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://thefitville.pxf.io/c/5597632/1526796/15852" target="_top" id="1526796"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/15852-1526796"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="628"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1526796/15852"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-4-iPhone-Apple-ID-Got-Locked-Here’s-a-Reliable-Tool-To-Get-It-Unlocked-Without-Passcode"><a href="#Part-4-iPhone-Apple-ID-Got-Locked-Here’s-a-Reliable-Tool-To-Get-It-Unlocked-Without-Passcode" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: iPhone Apple ID Got Locked?

It is because, while the data is being uploaded, logging out of Apple ID is restricted to ensure that data is not lost during the process.</p><h4 id="Solution"><a href="#Solution" class="headerlink" title="Solution"></a>Solution</h4><p>Wait for the iCloud backup to complete before attempting to log out. You can access the backup information through “iCloud” within your Apple ID settings of System Settings. Here, tap “iCloud Drive” and stop syncing to stop the ongoing iCloud backup process.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/10/change-apple-id-on-mac-7.jpg"                      alt="stop icloud backup process"                ></p><h3 id="2-Bug-in-macOS"><a href="#2-Bug-in-macOS" class="headerlink" title="2.

Here, select “<a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/iphone-data-recovery/recover-lost-date-after-ios-17-update.html"><u>Software Update</u></a>“ to verify if an update is available and if an update is available, use “Update Now” to update the macOS.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/10/change-apple-id-on-mac-8.jpg"                      alt="press the update now button"                ></p><h3 id="3-Apple-Server-Inactivity"><a href="#3-Apple-Server-Inactivity" class="headerlink" title="3.

Their style and presentation were not the only reason that made people look forward to buying an iPhone. Apple created its own operating system and presented their own versions of security and protection. One of the most recognized and impeccable features offered by Apple in its innovative structure was the security and safety through Apple ID and Apple Account. Every important feature that operated throughout the Apple iPhone 15 or iPad was focused over a single entity, the Apple ID. However, apart from the Apple ID, there were several other layers of authentications and verifications that were added throughout the protocol structure. A couple of them are renowned as Two Factor Verification and Two Factor Authentication. This article produces a very generous set of advice that should be looked over while handing these layers of protection. To get a better understanding of the procedures involved, you need to look over the guide to gain better knowledge on how to turn off Two Factor Authentication on your Apple.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2020/11/two-factor-authentication-apple.jpg"                      alt="two factor authentication apple"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://bluettieu.pxf.io/c/5597632/2042323/17091" target="_top" id="2042323"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17091-2042323"                      border="0" alt="BLUETTI NEW LAUNCH AC180T" width="3840" height="1600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2042323/17091"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-1-Is-two-step-verification-the-same-as-two-factor-authentication"><a href="#Part-1-Is-two-step-verification-the-same-as-two-factor-authentication" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. Is two-step verification the same as two-factor authentication?"></a>Part 1. Is two-step verification the same as two-factor authentication?</h2><p>There might be a few differences involved in these two security models; however, it should be kept in mind that they focus their purpose on securing the Apple ID of the user. Two Factor Verification is a security protocol that protects access to the various activities performed through the Apple ID. It attenuates an extra verification step across the Apple iPhone 15 device in addition to the password for the Apple ID. The device receives a verification code from an authentication factor that allows the authorities to confirm the credibility of the user.</p><p>The Two Factor Authentication is considered as an upgrade to the Two Factor Verification, which was released two years after the Two Factor Verification, in 2015. This authentication method exempted the offline recovery keys and application-specific passcodes. They added a six-digit authentication code onto the original password and produced an offline, time-dependent code that is to be generated through the Settings of the trusted device of the user. This feature was appended into the iOS 9 and OS X El Capitan with a region-specific target.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://bluetties.sjv.io/c/5597632/2039292/17094" target="_top" id="2039292"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17094-2039292"                      border="0" alt="BLUETTI NEW LAUNCH AC240" width="954" height="1020"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2039292/17094"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-turn-off-two-step-verification"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-turn-off-two-step-verification" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. How to turn off two-step verification?"></a>Part 2. How to turn off two-step verification?</h2><p>As you are aware of the Two-Step Verification process, it is quite easy and typical in configuring. However, when it comes to turning the settings off, it is also a simple and straightforward procedure that can be easily covered by following the steps provided below.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> You are required to open the Apple ID Account web page on your browser and sign in with your Apple ID credentials.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> As you log into the website, access the “Security” section, and tap “Edit” from the options provided on the list.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Tap on the “Two-Step Verification” option and turn it off. Confirm to conclude the process. You may be required to select the new security questions and verify the data of birth in the process. As you would be done with it, an email would be received across your connected address for confirmation.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-turn-off-two-factor-authentication-lower-than-iOS-10-3"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-turn-off-two-factor-authentication-lower-than-iOS-10-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 3. How to turn off two-factor authentication? (lower than iOS 10.3)"></a>Part 3. How to turn off two-factor authentication? (lower than iOS 10.3)</h2><p>Two Factor Authentication cannot be turned off in a few cases and accounts for iOS versions greater than 10.3. However, if you have activated Two Factor Authentication across the iOS versions lower than 10.3, you can deactivate the feature through a series of simple steps. The exemption of this security feature across your device leaves it protected only through a password and a few security questions. For turning off the Two Factor Authentication from your Apple device, you need to follow the steps provided as follows:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open your browser and access your Apple ID Account website. Provide the details of your Apple ID and log in.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Tap on “Edit” in the “Security” section and turn off the “Two Factor Authentication” option.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> This would lead you to set new security questions for the Apple ID account, followed by a verification of your date of birth. The successful execution of the process would lead to turning it off.</p><h2 id="Part-4-Why-can’t-you-turn-off-two-factor-authentication-if-you-already-use-it-iOS-10-3-and-later"><a href="#Part-4-Why-can’t-you-turn-off-two-factor-authentication-if-you-already-use-it-iOS-10-3-and-later" class="headerlink" title="Part 4. Why can’t you turn off two-factor authentication if you already use it? (iOS 10.3 and later)"></a>Part 4. Why can’t you turn off two-factor authentication if you already use it? (iOS 10.3 and later)</h2><p>For users who have an Apple device with an iOS 10.3 or later version, they cannot turn the Two Factor Authentication off after it is accessed. The latest iOS and macOS included extra layers of security in their features, which led towards a better security foundation and protection of information. Users who have updated their account information can unenroll in two weeks after updating. For this, you are required to simply access the confirmation email that you have received and tap on the link to approach the previous security settings. Thus, it makes it far more than impossible for users to turn their Two Factor Authentication off if they consider it unnecessary for their device. This feature is something that would always remain intact with their device as an extra layer of security. Its absence does leave a chance of illegal access to the Apple iPhone 15 device and an increased risk of a security breach. Since it is directly built across the Apple iPhone 15 device and its settings, this makes it a very hard-to-approach characteristic.</p><h2 id="Part-5-How-to-turn-off-two-factor-authentication-by-removing-Apple-ID"><a href="#Part-5-How-to-turn-off-two-factor-authentication-by-removing-Apple-ID" class="headerlink" title="Part 5. How to turn off two-factor authentication by removing Apple ID"></a>Part 5. How to turn off two-factor authentication by removing Apple ID</h2><p>Users who are very reluctant to remove the two-factor authentication off their device can consider removing the Apple ID itself for fulfilling the purpose. However, when it comes to executing such tasks, the need for a third-party platform gets evident. Third-party platforms provided dedicated services in providing users with a unique platform of operation with an environment that suits their purpose perfectly. Many platforms provide such impressive services, yet the selection gets quite difficult for a series of reasons. The following pointers explain the reasons to the users over why they should focus on selecting a platform such as <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/iphone-unlock/" >Dr. Fone – Screen Unlock (iOS) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for this purpose.</p><ul><li>You need to have no excessive knowledge of handling the platform.</li><li>You can cover all the dynamics of unlocking the Apple iPhone 15 device without the use of iTunes.</li><li>The platform provides you with the ability to unlock the passcode of your Apple device with ease.</li><li>It offers you to protect your device from the disabled state.</li><li>Works across all models of iPhone, iPad, and iPod Touch.</li><li>Provides services to the latest version of iOS.</li></ul><p>Dr. Fone – Screen Unlock (iOS) makes it easy for the users to control and remove their Apple ID and disable the two-factor authentication across their device.

This starts with the quality of hardware and the synergy with the software that runs the hardware, and the user experience you get. Apple puts great emphasis on this, and rightly so, for this is one of the keys defining and differentiating factors for people to choose Apple’s iOS over Google’s Android. Like with all good things in life, sometimes, a spanner is put in the works that bring your smooth-sailing life to an abrupt halt. With smartphones playing pivotal roles in our lives today, from payments to internet experiences to getting work done to stay in touch with people, anything that stops us from using our smartphone or endangers that experience is a cause for worry. A locked Apple ID is one such thing. It does not happen frequently, in fact, most users will never experience a locked Apple ID, but for the ones who are fortunate enough to have such a rare experience in life, help is at hand. All you need to do is relax and read on. By the end of it, you will have an unlocked Apple ID and you can go back to cruising.</p><h2 id="Part-I-Difference-Between-Activation-Lock-and-Locked-Apple-ID"><a href="#Part-I-Difference-Between-Activation-Lock-and-Locked-Apple-ID" class="headerlink" title="Part I: Difference Between Activation Lock and Locked Apple ID"></a>Part I: Difference Between Activation Lock and Locked Apple ID</h2><p>Apple being Apple, does a lot to make sure that users get the smoothest experience possible when interacting with their Apple products, both hardware, and software. Yet, sometimes, the messaging gets confusing, and people are not sure what is what. One such thing is the difference between iCloud Activation Lock and Apple ID Lock. While people are more likely to encounter Activation Lock and less likely to encounter Apple ID Lock, they are often confused when they encounter Apple ID Lock and struggle to figure out what that means and how to resolve the issue.</p><p>Activation Lock is when your supported Apple device is locked for a number of reasons. The most common reason is a stolen device that was locked by its owner, however, there are other perfectly valid reasons such as an outgoing employee forgetting to sign out and erase their Apple device before submitting it back. The IT department would not be able to reset that device without turning off Find My Apple iPhone 15 and Activation Lock on the Apple iPhone 15 device.</p><p>A locked Apple ID usually happens when the user has forgotten their password to their Apple ID account and attempts to figure out the password have been unsuccessful. Sometimes, Apple ID gets locked automatically under some conditions, and that requires users to reset their password to gain access. A locked Apple ID does not mean that your device is locked for your use. You can keep using it so long as you do not try to use another Apple ID with it since to do that you would have to sign out of your current Apple ID (which is locked) and you won’t be able to do that. On the other hand, Activation Lock renders the entire device unusable till the lock is cleared.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/10/unlock-apple-id-on-iphone-13-3.jpg"                      alt="apple id locked message"                ></p><p>In short, Apple ID Lock is about a user’s account with Apple, akin to how Google Account works on Android devices. Apple ID Lock locks a user’s account with Apple while retaining complete usage of the Apple iPhone 15 device whereas Activation Lock locks the Apple iPhone 15 device and prevents anyone from using it until the correct credentials are entered. This is about verifying the ownership of the Apple iPhone 15 device and works to deter theft of Apple devices.</p><h2 id="Part-II-Checking-If-Your-Apple-ID-Is-Locked"><a href="#Part-II-Checking-If-Your-Apple-ID-Is-Locked" class="headerlink" title="Part II: Checking If Your Apple ID Is Locked"></a>Part II: Checking If Your Apple ID Is Locked</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/10/unlock-apple-id-on-iphone-13-4.jpg"                      alt="the message of apple id locked"                ></p><p>A locked Apple ID is rather unmistakable. Your device would keep telling you that your Apple ID is locked for your security. Your Apple ID could be locked or disabled altogether if someone has tried to gain access to your account (and, obviously, failed). Apple would disable access to the Apple ID unless you are able to prove rightful ownership and reset the password successfully.</p><h2 id="Part-III-Reasons-for-Locked-Apple-ID"><a href="#Part-III-Reasons-for-Locked-Apple-ID" class="headerlink" title="Part III: Reasons for Locked Apple ID"></a>Part III: Reasons for Locked Apple ID</h2><p>There can be a few reasons why your Apple ID is locked. You forgot the password and now it is locked since you entered the wrong password too many times. A scarier prospect, albeit a real one, is that some malicious actor attempted to login into your Apple ID account but failed. Had they succeeded, you would have gotten a message that ‘your Apple ID is being used on another device’ now.</p><p>Apple does a lot to ensure that your Apple ID remains safe. You trust Apple with a lot of your data, including financial data by way of your credit cards associated with Apple ID to make purchases on the App Store and iTunes Store. Therefore, some of the time, Apple preempts issues by proactively locking up your Apple ID or even disabling it. It goes without saying that sometimes it is something so simple as a software error that is believed to have locked up Apple IDs for many users around the world a while ago. It is also entirely possible that it was some malicious actor probing the servers for accounts.</p><p>All of these will result in a locked Apple ID that users will have to reset their password to in order to gain access back.</p><h2 id="Part-IV-How-to-Unlock-Apple-ID-on-Apple-iPhone-15"><a href="#Part-IV-How-to-Unlock-Apple-ID-on-Apple-iPhone-15" class="headerlink" title="Part IV: How to Unlock Apple ID on Apple iPhone 15"></a>Part IV: How to Unlock Apple ID on Apple iPhone 15</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/10/unlock-apple-id-on-iphone-13-1.jpg"                      alt="apple id webpage"                ></p><p>It is unfortunate you are facing a locked Apple ID. Apple tries its best to make users aware of safety protocols they need to follow to minimize and mitigate such unfortunate occurrences, such as using two-factor authentication, trusted devices, trusted phone numbers, passwords, passcodes, etc. that serve as deterrents to prevent unauthorized access to devices and accounts. Yet, when the unfortunate happens, what to do?</p><h3 id="IV-I-Unlock-Apple-ID-Via-Two-Factor-Authentication"><a href="#IV-I-Unlock-Apple-ID-Via-Two-Factor-Authentication" class="headerlink" title="IV.I: Unlock Apple ID Via Two-Factor Authentication"></a>IV.I: Unlock Apple ID Via Two-Factor Authentication</h3><p>Apple implemented two-factor authentication a long time ago to prevent unauthorized access to Apple ID accounts.
