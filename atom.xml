    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="How-to-Fix-Locked-Apple-ID-on-Apple-iPhone-14"><a href="#How-to-Fix-Locked-Apple-ID-on-Apple-iPhone-14" class="headerlink" title="How to Fix Locked Apple ID on Apple iPhone 14"></a>How to Fix Locked Apple ID on Apple iPhone 14</h2><p>Part of why you own and use Apple devices is the reliability of the Apple iPhone 14 devices and the ease of using them. This starts with the quality of hardware and the synergy with the software that runs the hardware, and the user experience you get. Apple puts great emphasis on this, and rightly so, for this is one of the keys defining and differentiating factors for people to choose Apple’s iOS over Google’s Android. Like with all good things in life, sometimes, a spanner is put in the works that bring your smooth-sailing life to an abrupt halt. With smartphones playing pivotal roles in our lives today, from payments to internet experiences to getting work done to stay in touch with people, anything that stops us from using our smartphone or endangers that experience is a cause for worry. A locked Apple ID is one such thing. It does not happen frequently, in fact, most users will never experience a locked Apple ID, but for the ones who are fortunate enough to have such a rare experience in life, help is at hand. All you need to do is relax and read on. By the end of it, you will have an unlocked Apple ID and you can go back to cruising.</p><h2 id="Part-I-Difference-Between-Activation-Lock-and-Locked-Apple-ID"><a href="#Part-I-Difference-Between-Activation-Lock-and-Locked-Apple-ID" class="headerlink" title="Part I: Difference Between Activation Lock and Locked Apple ID"></a>Part I: Difference Between Activation Lock and Locked Apple ID</h2><p>Apple being Apple, does a lot to make sure that users get the smoothest experience possible when interacting with their Apple products, both hardware, and software. Yet, sometimes, the messaging gets confusing, and people are not sure what is what. One such thing is the difference between iCloud Activation Lock and Apple ID Lock. While people are more likely to encounter Activation Lock and less likely to encounter Apple ID Lock, they are often confused when they encounter Apple ID Lock and struggle to figure out what that means and how to resolve the issue.</p><p>Activation Lock is when your supported Apple device is locked for a number of reasons. The most common reason is a stolen device that was locked by its owner, however, there are other perfectly valid reasons such as an outgoing employee forgetting to sign out and erase their Apple device before submitting it back. The IT department would not be able to reset that device without turning off Find My Apple iPhone 14 and Activation Lock on the Apple iPhone 14 device.</p><p>A locked Apple ID usually happens when the user has forgotten their password to their Apple ID account and attempts to figure out the password have been unsuccessful. Sometimes, Apple ID gets locked automatically under some conditions, and that requires users to reset their password to gain access. A locked Apple ID does not mean that your device is locked for your use. You can keep using it so long as you do not try to use another Apple ID with it since to do that you would have to sign out of your current Apple ID (which is locked) and you won’t be able to do that. On the other hand, Activation Lock renders the entire device unusable till the lock is cleared.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/10/unlock-apple-id-on-iphone-13-3.jpg"                      alt="apple id locked message"                ></p><p>In short, Apple ID Lock is about a user’s account with Apple, akin to how Google Account works on Android devices. Apple ID Lock locks a user’s account with Apple while retaining complete usage of the Apple iPhone 14 device whereas Activation Lock locks the Apple iPhone 14 device and prevents anyone from using it until the correct credentials are entered. This is about verifying the ownership of the Apple iPhone 14 device and works to deter theft of Apple devices.</p><h2 id="Part-II-Checking-If-Your-Apple-ID-Is-Locked"><a href="#Part-II-Checking-If-Your-Apple-ID-Is-Locked" class="headerlink" title="Part II: Checking If Your Apple ID Is Locked"></a>Part II: Checking If Your Apple ID Is Locked</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/10/unlock-apple-id-on-iphone-13-4.jpg"                      alt="the message of apple id locked"                ></p><p>A locked Apple ID is rather unmistakable. Your device would keep telling you that your Apple ID is locked for your security. Your Apple ID could be locked or disabled altogether if someone has tried to gain access to your account (and, obviously, failed). Apple would disable access to the Apple ID unless you are able to prove rightful ownership and reset the password successfully.</p><h2 id="Part-III-Reasons-for-Locked-Apple-ID"><a href="#Part-III-Reasons-for-Locked-Apple-ID" class="headerlink" title="Part III: Reasons for Locked Apple ID"></a>Part III: Reasons for Locked Apple ID</h2><p>There can be a few reasons why your Apple ID is locked. You forgot the password and now it is locked since you entered the wrong password too many times. A scarier prospect, albeit a real one, is that some malicious actor attempted to login into your Apple ID account but failed. Had they succeeded, you would have gotten a message that ‘your Apple ID is being used on another device’ now.</p><p>Apple does a lot to ensure that your Apple ID remains safe. You trust Apple with a lot of your data, including financial data by way of your credit cards associated with Apple ID to make purchases on the App Store and iTunes Store. Therefore, some of the time, Apple preempts issues by proactively locking up your Apple ID or even disabling it. It goes without saying that sometimes it is something so simple as a software error that is believed to have locked up Apple IDs for many users around the world a while ago. It is also entirely possible that it was some malicious actor probing the servers for accounts.</p><p>All of these will result in a locked Apple ID that users will have to reset their password to in order to gain access back.</p><h2 id="Part-IV-How-to-Unlock-Apple-ID-on-Apple-iPhone-14"><a href="#Part-IV-How-to-Unlock-Apple-ID-on-Apple-iPhone-14" class="headerlink" title="Part IV: How to Unlock Apple ID on Apple iPhone 14"></a>Part IV: How to Unlock Apple ID on Apple iPhone 14</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/10/unlock-apple-id-on-iphone-13-1.jpg"                      alt="apple id webpage"                ></p><p>It is unfortunate you are facing a locked Apple ID.

This could be a simple typing error or misremembering your password. Repeated wrong attempts can also lead to your account being temporarily disabled as a security measure.</p><h3 id="Apple-Server-Issues"><a href="#Apple-Server-Issues" class="headerlink" title="Apple Server Issues"></a>Apple Server Issues</h3><p>At times, the problem may not be on your end. Apple’s servers can experience downtime or technical glitches like any other online service. During such instances, verification processes might fail, as the server cannot authenticate your credentials.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/apple-id-verification-not-working-02.jpg"                      alt="apple server status page"                ></p><h3 id="Slow-Internet-or-Intermittent-Connection"><a href="#Slow-Internet-or-Intermittent-Connection" class="headerlink" title="Slow Internet or Intermittent Connection"></a>Slow Internet or Intermittent Connection</h3><p>A stable and reliable internet connection is improtant for the verification process. If your internet is slow or experiencing intermittent connectivity, it can disrupt the communication between your device and Apple’s servers, leading to verification failure.</p><h3 id="Two-Factor-Authentication-2FA-Issues"><a href="#Two-Factor-Authentication-2FA-Issues" class="headerlink" title="Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) Issues"></a>Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) Issues</h3><p>Apple’s two-factor authentication provides an extra layer of security. However, it can also be a source of problems. If there’s a delay in receiving the 2FA code or if <a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/android-issue/authentication-error.html"><u>2FA fails to work</u></a>, you won’t be able to complete the verification process. This could be due to network issues or, sometimes, glitches within the 2FA system itself.</p><h3 id="Suspicious-Activity"><a href="#Suspicious-Activity" class="headerlink" title="Suspicious Activity"></a>Suspicious Activity</h3><p>Apple takes your security seriously. If there’s any unusual activity detected on your account, such as login attempts from unfamiliar locations or devices, Apple might lock your account as a precaution. This can trigger the verification failed prompt as the system seeks to protect your account from potential unauthorized access.</p><p>By understanding these scenarios, you can diagnose better why you’re facing the issue of <strong>Apple verification ID not working</strong>. In the following sections, we will explore solutions tailored to these specific problems, helping you regain access to your account efficiently.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-To-Fix-Apple-ID-Verification-Failed"><a href="#Part-2-How-To-Fix-Apple-ID-Verification-Failed" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How To Fix Apple ID Verification Failed"></a>Part 2: How To Fix Apple ID Verification Failed</h2><p>Encountering an “<strong>Apple ID Verification Failed</strong>” error can be frustrating.

However, after enabling the function, many iPhone users forget to remove it from the FindMy app ahead of time. Therefore, if you are selling or resetting the Apple iPhone 14 device, you need to <strong>remove AirTag from Apple ID</strong> to be usable later.</p><p>If someone removes the AirTag without resetting it while operating in the Bluetooth range, deleting AirTag ownership will require manually breaking the Apple iPhone 14 device apart and further configuration.</p><p>Remove this connection from the Apple ID account with simple steps first-hand to avoid that. Read on to know the steps involved in this process directly or with the best software alternative.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/01/how-to-remove-airtag-from-apple-id-1.jpg"                      alt="remove airtag on iphone"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-Exactly-Does-an-AirTag-Do"><a href="#Part-1-What-Exactly-Does-an-AirTag-Do" class="headerlink" title="Part 1.

What Exactly Does an AirTag Do?</h2><p>Before discussing <strong>how to remove AirTag from Apple ID,</strong> you should know better about the function itself. The AirTag feature is available for iOS devices. Therefore, one can register the AirTag process with the Apple ID you are utilizing on your smartphone.</p><p>Apple users can attach the AirTag to different objects like backpacks or keychains. This makes it simple to find these objects later in case they get misplaced or lost through the Find My app on the iPhone.</p><p>Users can add their AirTag to one Apple ID account, so you cannot access this from the Find My app via other accounts. In case of loss, you must remove the AirTag from your device entirely.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://bluettide.pxf.io/c/5597632/2042332/17092" target="_top" id="2042332"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17092-2042332"                      border="0" alt="BLUETTI NEW LAUNCH AC180T" width="960" height="900"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2042332/17092"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/01/how-to-remove-airtag-from-apple-id-2.jpg"                      alt="airtag model"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Remove-an-AirTag-from-Your-Apple-ID-onApple-iPhone-14-iPad"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Remove-an-AirTag-from-Your-Apple-ID-onApple-iPhone-14-iPad" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

It’s essential to resolve this matter promptly. The reason is that many essential procedures and services are directly linked to your Apple ID. Here are some common reasons why you might face difficulty logging out of the old Apple ID and their solutions:</p><h3 id="1-Ongoing-iCloud-Backup"><a href="#1-Ongoing-iCloud-Backup" class="headerlink" title="1. Ongoing iCloud Backup"></a>1. Ongoing iCloud Backup</h3><p>While the data is backed up on the iCloud from your Mac, you cannot log out from the Apple ID. It is because, while the data is being uploaded, logging out of Apple ID is restricted to ensure that data is not lost during the process.</p><h4 id="Solution"><a href="#Solution" class="headerlink" title="Solution"></a>Solution</h4><p>Wait for the iCloud backup to complete before attempting to log out. You can access the backup information through “iCloud” within your Apple ID settings of System Settings.

Enter the recovery key and click “<strong>Continue</strong>”.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2020/05/enter-recovery-key.jpg"                      alt="enter recovery key"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Choose a trusted device to receive the verification code.

Consider what your needs and preferences are when choosing between these two backup options.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/11/erase-an-iphone-without-apple-id-02.jpg"                      alt="several ways to backup iphone"                ></p><p>Prepare Your Apple iPhone 14 Passcode</p><p>You’ll need your Apple iPhone 14 passcode to erase an iPhone. <a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/forgot-passcode-on-iphone.html"><u> If you’ve forgotten your passcode</u></a>, reset it using recovery mode.</p><p>Ready Your Apple ID Password</p><p>You may be asked to provide your Apple ID password to disable the Find My iPhone function and remove the Apple iPhone 14 device from your account. Have it handy to avoid any delays. It’s necessary for security verification during the erasure process.</p><p>Unpair Apple Watch</p><p>If you own an Apple Watch, unpair it from your Apple iPhone 14.

You can cancel your AppleCare plan by phone by calling AppleCare customer support. It will prevent any unnecessary charges after the erasing process.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/11/erase-an-iphone-without-apple-id-04.jpg"                      alt="cancel an applecare plan"                ></p><p>Sign Out of iCloud</p><p>If your Apple iPhone 14 has iOS 10.3 or later, open the <strong>Settings</strong> app, then tap on your name at the top. Next, scroll down, tap <strong>Sign Out</strong>, enter your Apple ID password, and tap <strong>Turn Off</strong>.</p><p>Remove Your Apple iPhone 14 From Your List of Trusted Devices</p><p>Remove your old device from your list of trusted devices in your Apple ID settings for added security.

Due to this, they have added multiple security features, including two-factor authentication. Thus, if you create an Apple ID, you can see a two-factor authentication option that adds an extra layer of security.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/10/remove-two-factor-authentication-1.jpg"                      alt="what is two factor authentication"                ></p><p>2FA is activated when the user provides the password to log into the Apple ID or software through a new device, and it acts as a second layer for account security. Apple ID or any software containing sensitive data cannot be accessed without it. This method provides a higher security level than single-factor authentication. To understand more benefits of this security system in detail, check the following points:</p><ol><li><strong>Protection From Password Theft:</strong> 2FA acts as an additional security level. It protects your accounts and devices in case your password is leaked.</li><li><strong>Migrations of Unauthorized Assets:</strong> Online banking applications use 2FA to protect users from unauthorized bank transfers. If someone accesses their app, this is a beneficial security measure.</li><li><strong>Protection on Multiple Services:</strong> Platforms, including social media, banks, and cloud storage, use 2FA. It means that 2FA can be used in various digital aspects.</li></ol><h2 id="Part-2-Can-You-Remove-the-Two-Factor-Authentication-iCloud-at-Anytime"><a href="#Part-2-Can-You-Remove-the-Two-Factor-Authentication-iCloud-at-Anytime" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Can You Remove the Two Factor Authentication iCloud at Anytime"></a>Part 2: Can You Remove the Two Factor Authentication iCloud at Anytime</h2><p>Many people use 2FA globally to protect their personal information and devices from hackers and unauthorized access. However, in some cases, users may want to <strong>remove two-factor authentication iCloud</strong> for multiple reasons. This includes scenarios in which their device is lost or damaged or if they have found a better security option than this one.</p><p>Moreover, there is one important key point to note: Apple has removed the feature of deactivating 2FA from the Apple ID. It means you need to think twice before activating this feature on your Apple ID because it cannot be reversed. For the following reasons, Apple has taken this initiative:</p><ol><li><strong>Enhanced Security:</strong> By removing the deactivation option for 2FA, Apple is trying to strengthen its account security to ensure that no one can access its user’s data.</li><li><strong>Reducing Vulnerabilities:</strong> Allowing users to deactivate 2FA could cause vulnerabilities in the Apple ecosystem that can be a weak point for protecting users’ data. That is why Apple has removed the deactivation option to stop malicious actors from taking advantage of this vulnerability.</li><li><strong>Encouraging Security Awareness:</strong> To make Apple users more security conscious, Apple has made it difficult on purpose to remove 2FA. It helps users to be more confident in Apple services and products.</li><li><strong>Minimizing Mistakenly Steps:</strong> If users mistakenly remove the 2FA, their accounts and devices are at risk of being accessed without proper authentication. To avoid such an issue, the deactivation option of 2FA is removed.</li></ol><p>Besides all these reasons, there is still some good news for those who want to <strong>remove the two-factor authentication iPhone</strong> to use other security options. The good news is that Apple allows users to remove 2FA for a limited time after activation.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-To-Remove-the-Two-Factor-Authentication-Within-14-Days"><a href="#Part-3-How-To-Remove-the-Two-Factor-Authentication-Within-14-Days" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How To Remove the Two-Factor Authentication Within 14 Days"></a>Part 3: How To Remove the Two-Factor Authentication Within 14 Days</h2><p>As explained in the last part, Apple has made removing the 2FA option from Apple ID challenging for several security reasons. Thus, if you want to remove 2FA from your Apple ID, you have only 14 days after activating this feature. To understand <strong>how to disable iCloud two-factor authentication</strong> within this given time, check the following steps:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1.</strong> Once you have activated the 2FA feature, your 14-day grace period will start eventually. To deactivate this, open the enrollment email you received from Apple regarding 2FA on your Apple ID.</li><li><strong>Step 2.</strong> Scroll to the bottom of this email and select the link or button to return to your account security &amp; settings section. There, follow the on-screen instructions to deactivate the 2FA of your Apple ID.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/10/remove-two-factor-authentication-2.jpg"                      alt="deactivate two factor authentication"                ></p><h2 id="Part-4-iPhone-Apple-ID-Got-Locked-Here’s-a-Reliable-Tool-To-Get-It-Unlocked-Without-Passcode"><a href="#Part-4-iPhone-Apple-ID-Got-Locked-Here’s-a-Reliable-Tool-To-Get-It-Unlocked-Without-Passcode" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: iPhone Apple ID Got Locked?

Their style and presentation were not the only reason that made people look forward to buying an iPhone. Apple created its own operating system and presented their own versions of security and protection. One of the most recognized and impeccable features offered by Apple in its innovative structure was the security and safety through Apple ID and Apple Account. Every important feature that operated throughout the Apple iPhone 14 or iPad was focused over a single entity, the Apple ID. However, apart from the Apple ID, there were several other layers of authentications and verifications that were added throughout the protocol structure. A couple of them are renowned as Two Factor Verification and Two Factor Authentication. This article produces a very generous set of advice that should be looked over while handing these layers of protection. To get a better understanding of the procedures involved, you need to look over the guide to gain better knowledge on how to turn off Two Factor Authentication on your Apple.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2020/11/two-factor-authentication-apple.jpg"                      alt="two factor authentication apple"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-Is-two-step-verification-the-same-as-two-factor-authentication"><a href="#Part-1-Is-two-step-verification-the-same-as-two-factor-authentication" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. Is two-step verification the same as two-factor authentication?"></a>Part 1. Is two-step verification the same as two-factor authentication?</h2><p>There might be a few differences involved in these two security models; however, it should be kept in mind that they focus their purpose on securing the Apple ID of the user. Two Factor Verification is a security protocol that protects access to the various activities performed through the Apple ID. It attenuates an extra verification step across the Apple iPhone 14 device in addition to the password for the Apple ID. The device receives a verification code from an authentication factor that allows the authorities to confirm the credibility of the user.</p><p>The Two Factor Authentication is considered as an upgrade to the Two Factor Verification, which was released two years after the Two Factor Verification, in 2015. This authentication method exempted the offline recovery keys and application-specific passcodes. They added a six-digit authentication code onto the original password and produced an offline, time-dependent code that is to be generated through the Settings of the trusted device of the user. This feature was appended into the iOS 9 and OS X El Capitan with a region-specific target.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-turn-off-two-step-verification"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-turn-off-two-step-verification" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. How to turn off two-step verification?"></a>Part 2. How to turn off two-step verification?</h2><p>As you are aware of the Two-Step Verification process, it is quite easy and typical in configuring. However, when it comes to turning the settings off, it is also a simple and straightforward procedure that can be easily covered by following the steps provided below.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> You are required to open the Apple ID Account web page on your browser and sign in with your Apple ID credentials.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> As you log into the website, access the “Security” section, and tap “Edit” from the options provided on the list.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Tap on the “Two-Step Verification” option and turn it off. Confirm to conclude the process. You may be required to select the new security questions and verify the data of birth in the process. As you would be done with it, an email would be received across your connected address for confirmation.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-turn-off-two-factor-authentication-lower-than-iOS-10-3"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-turn-off-two-factor-authentication-lower-than-iOS-10-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 3. How to turn off two-factor authentication? (lower than iOS 10.3)"></a>Part 3. How to turn off two-factor authentication? (lower than iOS 10.3)</h2><p>Two Factor Authentication cannot be turned off in a few cases and accounts for iOS versions greater than 10.3. However, if you have activated Two Factor Authentication across the iOS versions lower than 10.3, you can deactivate the feature through a series of simple steps. The exemption of this security feature across your device leaves it protected only through a password and a few security questions. For turning off the Two Factor Authentication from your Apple device, you need to follow the steps provided as follows:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open your browser and access your Apple ID Account website. Provide the details of your Apple ID and log in.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Tap on “Edit” in the “Security” section and turn off the “Two Factor Authentication” option.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> This would lead you to set new security questions for the Apple ID account, followed by a verification of your date of birth. The successful execution of the process would lead to turning it off.</p><h2 id="Part-4-Why-can’t-you-turn-off-two-factor-authentication-if-you-already-use-it-iOS-10-3-and-later"><a href="#Part-4-Why-can’t-you-turn-off-two-factor-authentication-if-you-already-use-it-iOS-10-3-and-later" class="headerlink" title="Part 4. Why can’t you turn off two-factor authentication if you already use it? (iOS 10.3 and later)"></a>Part 4. Why can’t you turn off two-factor authentication if you already use it? (iOS 10.3 and later)</h2><p>For users who have an Apple device with an iOS 10.3 or later version, they cannot turn the Two Factor Authentication off after it is accessed. The latest iOS and macOS included extra layers of security in their features, which led towards a better security foundation and protection of information. Users who have updated their account information can unenroll in two weeks after updating. For this, you are required to simply access the confirmation email that you have received and tap on the link to approach the previous security settings. Thus, it makes it far more than impossible for users to turn their Two Factor Authentication off if they consider it unnecessary for their device. This feature is something that would always remain intact with their device as an extra layer of security. Its absence does leave a chance of illegal access to the Apple iPhone 14 device and an increased risk of a security breach. Since it is directly built across the Apple iPhone 14 device and its settings, this makes it a very hard-to-approach characteristic.</p><h2 id="Part-5-How-to-turn-off-two-factor-authentication-by-removing-Apple-ID"><a href="#Part-5-How-to-turn-off-two-factor-authentication-by-removing-Apple-ID" class="headerlink" title="Part 5. How to turn off two-factor authentication by removing Apple ID"></a>Part 5. How to turn off two-factor authentication by removing Apple ID</h2><p>Users who are very reluctant to remove the two-factor authentication off their device can consider removing the Apple ID itself for fulfilling the purpose. However, when it comes to executing such tasks, the need for a third-party platform gets evident. Third-party platforms provided dedicated services in providing users with a unique platform of operation with an environment that suits their purpose perfectly. Many platforms provide such impressive services, yet the selection gets quite difficult for a series of reasons.

Once the platform is done with the process, it provides a prompt message in the next window displaying the execution of the removal of Apple ID from your device. This also removes the Two Factor Authentication off your device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/remove-apple-id-8.png"                      alt="complete"                ></p><h2 id="Conclusion-2"><a href="#Conclusion-2" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>The article has presented a very detailed comparison of the Two Factor Verification and Two Factor Authentication and provided an elaborated discussion over how to turn these security features off their devices.

Similarly, power off all devices where the targeted Apple ID is logged in.</p><p>You can further shorten the process by using the verification code sent to your primary email. As far as the progress of the procedure is concerned, you can view it on the iForgot website by adding your Apple ID.</p><h2 id="Way-6-Make-Apple-ID-Account-Recovery-Easy-With-Wondershare-Dr-Fone"><a href="#Way-6-Make-Apple-ID-Account-Recovery-Easy-With-Wondershare-Dr-Fone" class="headerlink" title="Way 6: Make Apple ID Account Recovery Easy With Wondershare Dr.Fone"></a>Way 6: Make Apple ID Account Recovery Easy With Wondershare Dr.Fone</h2><p>If you have been trying all the solutions and the Apple ID account has not yet recovered, then you need a more solid solution.

With these innovations, companies like Apple and Google have introduced the two-factor authentication process to protect user data.</p><p>But sometimes, this security method becomes a hassle to access your data daily, due to which many users try to remove it.

Due to this, they have added multiple security features, including two-factor authentication. Thus, if you create an Apple ID, you can see a two-factor authentication option that adds an extra layer of security.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/10/remove-two-factor-authentication-1.jpg"                      alt="what is two factor authentication"                ></p><p>2FA is activated when the user provides the password to log into the Apple ID or software through a new device, and it acts as a second layer for account security. Apple ID or any software containing sensitive data cannot be accessed without it. This method provides a higher security level than single-factor authentication. To understand more benefits of this security system in detail, check the following points:</p><ol><li><strong>Protection From Password Theft:</strong> 2FA acts as an additional security level. It protects your accounts and devices in case your password is leaked.</li><li><strong>Migrations of Unauthorized Assets:</strong> Online banking applications use 2FA to protect users from unauthorized bank transfers. If someone accesses their app, this is a beneficial security measure.</li><li><strong>Protection on Multiple Services:</strong> Platforms, including social media, banks, and cloud storage, use 2FA. It means that 2FA can be used in various digital aspects.</li></ol><h2 id="Part-2-Can-You-Remove-the-Two-Factor-Authentication-iCloud-at-Anytime"><a href="#Part-2-Can-You-Remove-the-Two-Factor-Authentication-iCloud-at-Anytime" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Can You Remove the Two Factor Authentication iCloud at Anytime"></a>Part 2: Can You Remove the Two Factor Authentication iCloud at Anytime</h2><p>Many people use 2FA globally to protect their personal information and devices from hackers and unauthorized access. However, in some cases, users may want to <strong>remove two-factor authentication iCloud</strong> for multiple reasons. This includes scenarios in which their device is lost or damaged or if they have found a better security option than this one.</p><p>Moreover, there is one important key point to note: Apple has removed the feature of deactivating 2FA from the Apple ID. It means you need to think twice before activating this feature on your Apple ID because it cannot be reversed. For the following reasons, Apple has taken this initiative:</p><ol><li><strong>Enhanced Security:</strong> By removing the deactivation option for 2FA, Apple is trying to strengthen its account security to ensure that no one can access its user’s data.</li><li><strong>Reducing Vulnerabilities:</strong> Allowing users to deactivate 2FA could cause vulnerabilities in the Apple ecosystem that can be a weak point for protecting users’ data. That is why Apple has removed the deactivation option to stop malicious actors from taking advantage of this vulnerability.</li><li><strong>Encouraging Security Awareness:</strong> To make Apple users more security conscious, Apple has made it difficult on purpose to remove 2FA. It helps users to be more confident in Apple services and products.</li><li><strong>Minimizing Mistakenly Steps:</strong> If users mistakenly remove the 2FA, their accounts and devices are at risk of being accessed without proper authentication. To avoid such an issue, the deactivation option of 2FA is removed.</li></ol><p>Besides all these reasons, there is still some good news for those who want to <strong>remove the two-factor authentication iPhone</strong> to use other security options. The good news is that Apple allows users to remove 2FA for a limited time after activation.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-To-Remove-the-Two-Factor-Authentication-Within-14-Days"><a href="#Part-3-How-To-Remove-the-Two-Factor-Authentication-Within-14-Days" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How To Remove the Two-Factor Authentication Within 14 Days"></a>Part 3: How To Remove the Two-Factor Authentication Within 14 Days</h2><p>As explained in the last part, Apple has made removing the 2FA option from Apple ID challenging for several security reasons. Thus, if you want to remove 2FA from your Apple ID, you have only 14 days after activating this feature. To understand <strong>how to disable iCloud two-factor authentication</strong> within this given time, check the following steps:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1.</strong> Once you have activated the 2FA feature, your 14-day grace period will start eventually. To deactivate this, open the enrollment email you received from Apple regarding 2FA on your Apple ID.</li><li><strong>Step 2.</strong> Scroll to the bottom of this email and select the link or button to return to your account security &amp; settings section. There, follow the on-screen instructions to deactivate the 2FA of your Apple ID.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/10/remove-two-factor-authentication-2.jpg"                      alt="deactivate two factor authentication"                ></p><h2 id="Part-4-iPhone-Apple-ID-Got-Locked-Here’s-a-Reliable-Tool-To-Get-It-Unlocked-Without-Passcode"><a href="#Part-4-iPhone-Apple-ID-Got-Locked-Here’s-a-Reliable-Tool-To-Get-It-Unlocked-Without-Passcode" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: iPhone Apple ID Got Locked?

Due to this, they have added multiple security features, including two-factor authentication. Thus, if you create an Apple ID, you can see a two-factor authentication option that adds an extra layer of security.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/10/remove-two-factor-authentication-1.jpg"                      alt="what is two factor authentication"                ></p><p>2FA is activated when the user provides the password to log into the Apple ID or software through a new device, and it acts as a second layer for account security. Apple ID or any software containing sensitive data cannot be accessed without it. This method provides a higher security level than single-factor authentication. To understand more benefits of this security system in detail, check the following points:</p><ol><li><strong>Protection From Password Theft:</strong> 2FA acts as an additional security level. It protects your accounts and devices in case your password is leaked.</li><li><strong>Migrations of Unauthorized Assets:</strong> Online banking applications use 2FA to protect users from unauthorized bank transfers. If someone accesses their app, this is a beneficial security measure.</li><li><strong>Protection on Multiple Services:</strong> Platforms, including social media, banks, and cloud storage, use 2FA. It means that 2FA can be used in various digital aspects.</li></ol><h2 id="Part-2-Can-You-Remove-the-Two-Factor-Authentication-iCloud-at-Anytime"><a href="#Part-2-Can-You-Remove-the-Two-Factor-Authentication-iCloud-at-Anytime" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Can You Remove the Two Factor Authentication iCloud at Anytime"></a>Part 2: Can You Remove the Two Factor Authentication iCloud at Anytime</h2><p>Many people use 2FA globally to protect their personal information and devices from hackers and unauthorized access. However, in some cases, users may want to <strong>remove two-factor authentication iCloud</strong> for multiple reasons. This includes scenarios in which their device is lost or damaged or if they have found a better security option than this one.</p><p>Moreover, there is one important key point to note: Apple has removed the feature of deactivating 2FA from the Apple ID. It means you need to think twice before activating this feature on your Apple ID because it cannot be reversed. For the following reasons, Apple has taken this initiative:</p><ol><li><strong>Enhanced Security:</strong> By removing the deactivation option for 2FA, Apple is trying to strengthen its account security to ensure that no one can access its user’s data.</li><li><strong>Reducing Vulnerabilities:</strong> Allowing users to deactivate 2FA could cause vulnerabilities in the Apple ecosystem that can be a weak point for protecting users’ data. That is why Apple has removed the deactivation option to stop malicious actors from taking advantage of this vulnerability.</li><li><strong>Encouraging Security Awareness:</strong> To make Apple users more security conscious, Apple has made it difficult on purpose to remove 2FA. It helps users to be more confident in Apple services and products.</li><li><strong>Minimizing Mistakenly Steps:</strong> If users mistakenly remove the 2FA, their accounts and devices are at risk of being accessed without proper authentication. To avoid such an issue, the deactivation option of 2FA is removed.</li></ol><p>Besides all these reasons, there is still some good news for those who want to <strong>remove the two-factor authentication iPhone</strong> to use other security options. The good news is that Apple allows users to remove 2FA for a limited time after activation.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-To-Remove-the-Two-Factor-Authentication-Within-14-Days"><a href="#Part-3-How-To-Remove-the-Two-Factor-Authentication-Within-14-Days" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How To Remove the Two-Factor Authentication Within 14 Days"></a>Part 3: How To Remove the Two-Factor Authentication Within 14 Days</h2><p>As explained in the last part, Apple has made removing the 2FA option from Apple ID challenging for several security reasons. Thus, if you want to remove 2FA from your Apple ID, you have only 14 days after activating this feature. To understand <strong>how to disable iCloud two-factor authentication</strong> within this given time, check the following steps:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1.</strong> Once you have activated the 2FA feature, your 14-day grace period will start eventually. To deactivate this, open the enrollment email you received from Apple regarding 2FA on your Apple ID.</li><li><strong>Step 2.</strong> Scroll to the bottom of this email and select the link or button to return to your account security &amp; settings section. There, follow the on-screen instructions to deactivate the 2FA of your Apple ID.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/10/remove-two-factor-authentication-2.jpg"                      alt="deactivate two factor authentication"                ></p><h2 id="Part-4-iPhone-Apple-ID-Got-Locked-Here’s-a-Reliable-Tool-To-Get-It-Unlocked-Without-Passcode"><a href="#Part-4-iPhone-Apple-ID-Got-Locked-Here’s-a-Reliable-Tool-To-Get-It-Unlocked-Without-Passcode" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: iPhone Apple ID Got Locked?

If you’re unsure about this irreversible action, consider deactivating your account. Deactivating your Apple ID temporarily suspends it. However, this feature may depend on your location.</p><p>Once you deactivate your Apple ID, you can no longer use it to sign into any Apple services, including iCloud, the App Store, iTunes, Apple Books, FaceTime, and Apple Pay. Even so, deactivating your Apple ID does not delete your account. You can reactivate your account anytime to regain access to all your Apple services and data.</p><p>Here’s how to temporarily deactivate your Apple ID account:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Go to Apple’s Data and Privacy website. Sign in using your Apple ID.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Scroll down to the <strong>Temporarily deactivate your account</strong> section and click <strong>Request to deactivate your account</strong>.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/11/how-to-delete-icloud-account-26.jpg"                      alt="request to deactivate your account"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Select a reason for deactivating your account from the drop-down menu, then click <strong>Continue</strong>.</li><li><strong>Step 4:</strong> Review the information and follow the on-screen instructions to complete deactivation.</li></ul><p><strong>Note:</strong></p><p>Keep the unique alphanumeric access code you’ll receive.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Turning-Off-Two-Factor-Authentication-On-Apple-iPhone-14-5-Tips-You-Must-Know"><a href="#Turning-Off-Two-Factor-Authentication-On-Apple-iPhone-14-5-Tips-You-Must-Know" class="headerlink" title="Turning Off Two Factor Authentication On Apple iPhone 14? 5 Tips You Must Know"></a>Turning Off Two Factor Authentication On Apple iPhone 14? 5 Tips You Must Know</h2><p>Apple has produced one of the most consumed, acknowledged, and preferred smartphones that allowed them to rule the industry for a considerably long period of time. Their style and presentation were not the only reason that made people look forward to buying an iPhone. Apple created its own operating system and presented their own versions of security and protection. One of the most recognized and impeccable features offered by Apple in its innovative structure was the security and safety through Apple ID and Apple Account. Every important feature that operated throughout the Apple iPhone 14 or iPad was focused over a single entity, the Apple ID. However, apart from the Apple ID, there were several other layers of authentications and verifications that were added throughout the protocol structure. A couple of them are renowned as Two Factor Verification and Two Factor Authentication. This article produces a very generous set of advice that should be looked over while handing these layers of protection. To get a better understanding of the procedures involved, you need to look over the guide to gain better knowledge on how to turn off Two Factor Authentication on your Apple.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2020/11/two-factor-authentication-apple.jpg"                      alt="two factor authentication apple"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-Is-two-step-verification-the-same-as-two-factor-authentication"><a href="#Part-1-Is-two-step-verification-the-same-as-two-factor-authentication" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. Is two-step verification the same as two-factor authentication?"></a>Part 1. Is two-step verification the same as two-factor authentication?</h2><p>There might be a few differences involved in these two security models; however, it should be kept in mind that they focus their purpose on securing the Apple ID of the user. Two Factor Verification is a security protocol that protects access to the various activities performed through the Apple ID. It attenuates an extra verification step across the Apple iPhone 14 device in addition to the password for the Apple ID. The device receives a verification code from an authentication factor that allows the authorities to confirm the credibility of the user.</p><p>The Two Factor Authentication is considered as an upgrade to the Two Factor Verification, which was released two years after the Two Factor Verification, in 2015. This authentication method exempted the offline recovery keys and application-specific passcodes. They added a six-digit authentication code onto the original password and produced an offline, time-dependent code that is to be generated through the Settings of the trusted device of the user. This feature was appended into the iOS 9 and OS X El Capitan with a region-specific target.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2075461/7443" target="_top" id="2075461"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2075461"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2075461/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-turn-off-two-step-verification"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-turn-off-two-step-verification" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. How to turn off two-step verification?"></a>Part 2. How to turn off two-step verification?</h2><p>As you are aware of the Two-Step Verification process, it is quite easy and typical in configuring. However, when it comes to turning the settings off, it is also a simple and straightforward procedure that can be easily covered by following the steps provided below.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> You are required to open the Apple ID Account web page on your browser and sign in with your Apple ID credentials.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> As you log into the website, access the “Security” section, and tap “Edit” from the options provided on the list.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Tap on the “Two-Step Verification” option and turn it off. Confirm to conclude the process. You may be required to select the new security questions and verify the data of birth in the process. As you would be done with it, an email would be received across your connected address for confirmation.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-turn-off-two-factor-authentication-lower-than-iOS-10-3"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-turn-off-two-factor-authentication-lower-than-iOS-10-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 3. How to turn off two-factor authentication? (lower than iOS 10.3)"></a>Part 3. How to turn off two-factor authentication? (lower than iOS 10.3)</h2><p>Two Factor Authentication cannot be turned off in a few cases and accounts for iOS versions greater than 10.3. However, if you have activated Two Factor Authentication across the iOS versions lower than 10.3, you can deactivate the feature through a series of simple steps. The exemption of this security feature across your device leaves it protected only through a password and a few security questions. For turning off the Two Factor Authentication from your Apple device, you need to follow the steps provided as follows:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open your browser and access your Apple ID Account website. Provide the details of your Apple ID and log in.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Tap on “Edit” in the “Security” section and turn off the “Two Factor Authentication” option.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> This would lead you to set new security questions for the Apple ID account, followed by a verification of your date of birth. The successful execution of the process would lead to turning it off.</p><h2 id="Part-4-Why-can’t-you-turn-off-two-factor-authentication-if-you-already-use-it-iOS-10-3-and-later"><a href="#Part-4-Why-can’t-you-turn-off-two-factor-authentication-if-you-already-use-it-iOS-10-3-and-later" class="headerlink" title="Part 4. Why can’t you turn off two-factor authentication if you already use it? (iOS 10.3 and later)"></a>Part 4. Why can’t you turn off two-factor authentication if you already use it? (iOS 10.3 and later)</h2><p>For users who have an Apple device with an iOS 10.3 or later version, they cannot turn the Two Factor Authentication off after it is accessed. The latest iOS and macOS included extra layers of security in their features, which led towards a better security foundation and protection of information. Users who have updated their account information can unenroll in two weeks after updating. For this, you are required to simply access the confirmation email that you have received and tap on the link to approach the previous security settings. Thus, it makes it far more than impossible for users to turn their Two Factor Authentication off if they consider it unnecessary for their device. This feature is something that would always remain intact with their device as an extra layer of security. Its absence does leave a chance of illegal access to the Apple iPhone 14 device and an increased risk of a security breach. Since it is directly built across the Apple iPhone 14 device and its settings, this makes it a very hard-to-approach characteristic.</p><h2 id="Part-5-How-to-turn-off-two-factor-authentication-by-removing-Apple-ID"><a href="#Part-5-How-to-turn-off-two-factor-authentication-by-removing-Apple-ID" class="headerlink" title="Part 5. How to turn off two-factor authentication by removing Apple ID"></a>Part 5. How to turn off two-factor authentication by removing Apple ID</h2><p>Users who are very reluctant to remove the two-factor authentication off their device can consider removing the Apple ID itself for fulfilling the purpose. However, when it comes to executing such tasks, the need for a third-party platform gets evident. Third-party platforms provided dedicated services in providing users with a unique platform of operation with an environment that suits their purpose perfectly. Many platforms provide such impressive services, yet the selection gets quite difficult for a series of reasons. The following pointers explain the reasons to the users over why they should focus on selecting a platform such as <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/iphone-unlock/" >Dr. Fone – Screen Unlock (iOS) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for this purpose.</p><ul><li>You need to have no excessive knowledge of handling the platform.</li><li>You can cover all the dynamics of unlocking the Apple iPhone 14 device without the use of iTunes.</li><li>The platform provides you with the ability to unlock the passcode of your Apple device with ease.</li><li>It offers you to protect your device from the disabled state.</li><li>Works across all models of iPhone, iPad, and iPod Touch.</li><li>Provides services to the latest version of iOS.</li></ul><p>Dr. Fone – Screen Unlock (iOS) makes it easy for the users to control and remove their Apple ID and disable the two-factor authentication across their device. However, when it comes to controlling the platform, it follows a few simple and efficient steps that would guide you in executing the task successfully.</p><p><strong>Step 1: Connect your Device and Launch Application</strong></p><p>You need to connect your Apple device with the desktop and launch Dr. Fone across the computer. Tap on the “Screen Unlock” tool present on the home window and proceed with the removal of two-factor authentication.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png"                      alt="drfone home"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2: Access Appropriate Option</strong></p><p>On the next screen that opens, you are required to select “Unlock Apple ID” from the three options. Proceed to your Apple device to take the process further.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/android-screen-unlock-2.png"                      alt="drfone android ios unlock"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3: Trust the Computer</strong></p><p>Open the Apple iPhone 14 device and tap on “Trust” over the prompt that appears on the screen. Following this, you need to navigate to the Settings of your device to initiate a reboot.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/drfone/trust-computer.jpg"                      alt="trust computer"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4: Execution of Process</strong></p><p>Once you are done with initiating a reboot, the platform automatically detects the update in the process and initiates removing the Apple ID from the Apple iPhone 14 device. Once the platform is done with the process, it provides a prompt message in the next window displaying the execution of the removal of Apple ID from your device. This also removes the Two Factor Authentication off your device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/remove-apple-id-8.png"                      alt="complete"                ></p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>The article has presented a very detailed comparison of the Two Factor Verification and Two Factor Authentication and provided an elaborated discussion over how to turn these security features off their devices. The article also discussed a third-party platform that would guide in removing such security features of the Apple iPhone 14 devices over the requirement of the user.

The Apple iPhone 14 Apple ID will allow you to store and control data available on the Apple iPhone 14 device; however, you need to re-generate the Apple iPhone 14 passcode if you have forgotten the Apple iPhone 14 passcode. Suppose, if you have forgotten the passcode and entered the wrong passcode six times, your Apple iPhone 14 gets locked or has been disabled. According to your settings, if you have entered the wrong passcode too much time could even make your Apple iPhone 14 delete all the data available.</p><p>This article will discuss how you can <strong>unlock Apple ID</strong> and remain secure. If you receive a message that you have entered the wrong passcode or forgotten your passcode, you have to follow some steps to regain access to your Apple Id.</p><h2 id="Why-Is-Your-Apple-ID-Locked-or-Disabled"><a href="#Why-Is-Your-Apple-ID-Locked-or-Disabled" class="headerlink" title="Why Is Your Apple ID Locked or Disabled?"></a>Why Is Your Apple ID Locked or Disabled?</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/03/apple-id-locked.png"                      alt="apple id locked"                ></p><p>Some of the reasons causing your Apple ID locked or disabled are listed below:</p><ul><li>If you have entered the wrong passcode or security question too many times in a row, Apple ID gets locked. (Avoid entering the incorrect password more than 3 times)</li><li>If you haven’t used your Apple ID for an extended period, possibly making your Apple ID disabled or locked. When Apple modifies the requirement for passcode and security questions, you have not updated the information.</li></ul><p>If you frequently change your Apple ID or passcode on the Apple iPhone 14 device, Apple possibly considers that your Apple iPhone 14 faces a security threat and might lock your Apple ID.</p><h2 id="Method-1-Professional-iPhone-Apple-ID-Lock-Removal-Tool-Recommended"><a href="#Method-1-Professional-iPhone-Apple-ID-Lock-Removal-Tool-Recommended" class="headerlink" title="Method 1: Professional iPhone Apple ID Lock Removal Tool [Recommended]"></a>Method 1: Professional iPhone Apple ID Lock Removal Tool [Recommended]</h2><p>If you have forgotten your Apple ID password, you are suggested not to enter the wrong passcode in a row.
