Due to this, they have added multiple security features, including two-factor authentication. Thus, if you create an Apple ID, you can see a two-factor authentication option that adds an extra layer of security.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/10/remove-two-factor-authentication-1.jpg"                      alt="what is two factor authentication"                ></p><p>2FA is activated when the user provides the password to log into the Apple ID or software through a new device, and it acts as a second layer for account security. Apple ID or any software containing sensitive data cannot be accessed without it. This method provides a higher security level than single-factor authentication. To understand more benefits of this security system in detail, check the following points:</p><ol><li><strong>Protection From Password Theft:</strong> 2FA acts as an additional security level. It protects your accounts and devices in case your password is leaked.</li><li><strong>Migrations of Unauthorized Assets:</strong> Online banking applications use 2FA to protect users from unauthorized bank transfers. If someone accesses their app, this is a beneficial security measure.</li><li><strong>Protection on Multiple Services:</strong> Platforms, including social media, banks, and cloud storage, use 2FA. It means that 2FA can be used in various digital aspects.</li></ol><h2 id="Part-2-Can-You-Remove-the-Two-Factor-Authentication-iCloud-at-Anytime"><a href="#Part-2-Can-You-Remove-the-Two-Factor-Authentication-iCloud-at-Anytime" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Can You Remove the Two Factor Authentication iCloud at Anytime"></a>Part 2: Can You Remove the Two Factor Authentication iCloud at Anytime</h2><p>Many people use 2FA globally to protect their personal information and devices from hackers and unauthorized access. However, in some cases, users may want to <strong>remove two-factor authentication iCloud</strong> for multiple reasons. This includes scenarios in which their device is lost or damaged or if they have found a better security option than this one.</p><p>Moreover, there is one important key point to note: Apple has removed the feature of deactivating 2FA from the Apple ID. It means you need to think twice before activating this feature on your Apple ID because it cannot be reversed. For the following reasons, Apple has taken this initiative:</p><ol><li><strong>Enhanced Security:</strong> By removing the deactivation option for 2FA, Apple is trying to strengthen its account security to ensure that no one can access its user’s data.</li><li><strong>Reducing Vulnerabilities:</strong> Allowing users to deactivate 2FA could cause vulnerabilities in the Apple ecosystem that can be a weak point for protecting users’ data. That is why Apple has removed the deactivation option to stop malicious actors from taking advantage of this vulnerability.</li><li><strong>Encouraging Security Awareness:</strong> To make Apple users more security conscious, Apple has made it difficult on purpose to remove 2FA. It helps users to be more confident in Apple services and products.</li><li><strong>Minimizing Mistakenly Steps:</strong> If users mistakenly remove the 2FA, their accounts and devices are at risk of being accessed without proper authentication. To avoid such an issue, the deactivation option of 2FA is removed.</li></ol><p>Besides all these reasons, there is still some good news for those who want to <strong>remove the two-factor authentication iPhone</strong> to use other security options. The good news is that Apple allows users to remove 2FA for a limited time after activation.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-To-Remove-the-Two-Factor-Authentication-Within-14-Days"><a href="#Part-3-How-To-Remove-the-Two-Factor-Authentication-Within-14-Days" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How To Remove the Two-Factor Authentication Within 14 Days"></a>Part 3: How To Remove the Two-Factor Authentication Within 14 Days</h2><p>As explained in the last part, Apple has made removing the 2FA option from Apple ID challenging for several security reasons. Thus, if you want to remove 2FA from your Apple ID, you have only 14 days after activating this feature. To understand <strong>how to disable iCloud two-factor authentication</strong> within this given time, check the following steps:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1.</strong> Once you have activated the 2FA feature, your 14-day grace period will start eventually. To deactivate this, open the enrollment email you received from Apple regarding 2FA on your Apple ID.</li><li><strong>Step 2.</strong> Scroll to the bottom of this email and select the link or button to return to your account security &amp; settings section. There, follow the on-screen instructions to deactivate the 2FA of your Apple ID.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/10/remove-two-factor-authentication-2.jpg"                      alt="deactivate two factor authentication"                ></p><h2 id="Part-4-iPhone-Apple-ID-Got-Locked-Here’s-a-Reliable-Tool-To-Get-It-Unlocked-Without-Passcode"><a href="#Part-4-iPhone-Apple-ID-Got-Locked-Here’s-a-Reliable-Tool-To-Get-It-Unlocked-Without-Passcode" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: iPhone Apple ID Got Locked?

Let’s now proceed to the actionable steps for accomplishing this task. Below is a comprehensive, step-by-step tutorial on how to <strong>change your Apple ID on a MacBook</strong>with the help of System Settings:</p><ul><li>**Step 1:**Access your Mac’s System Setting through the Dock. Tap the Apple ID icon from the left sidebar within the “System Settings.”</li><li>**Step 2:**Here, scroll down to find and tap “Sign Out.” The option is located at the bottom near the left corner.

There are scenarios where some adjustments may be necessary and some may not. For instance, in the case of purchasing a used MacBook, it’s conceivable that the prior owner’s Apple ID could still be linked to the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device.</p><p>In such instances, you’ll need to contact the previous owner and request them to disassociate their Apple ID. Here are two practical methods for <strong>how to change Apple ID on MacBook Air</strong>:</p><h3 id="Way-1-Using-the-iPhone"><a href="#Way-1-Using-the-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Way 1: Using the iPhone"></a>Way 1: Using the iPhone</h3><p>The first way the previous owner can remove the Apple ID from your MacBook is by using his iPhone. You can ask the previous owner to follow these steps on their iPhone:</p><ul><li>**Step 1:**Start the process by accessing the Settings app on your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max. From there, click on Apple ID on top of the main settings page.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/10/change-apple-id-on-mac-3.jpg"                      alt="access the apple id settings"                ></p><ul><li>**Step 2:**Scroll down on the screen to devices that are connected with the Apple ID. Tap on the MacBook and use the “Remove from Account” option to <a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/apple-account/how-to-remove-phone-number-from-apple-id.html"><u>remove Apple ID</u></a> from MacBook.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/10/change-apple-id-on-mac-4.jpg"                      alt="choose remove from account option"                ></p><h3 id="Way-2-Using-Find-My-App"><a href="#Way-2-Using-Find-My-App" class="headerlink" title="Way 2: Using Find My App"></a>Way 2: Using Find My App</h3><p>Another way to remove the Apple ID is by asking the previous owner to use the Find My service. The steps for removing Apple ID using the Find My app are given below:</p><ul><li>**Step 1:**Begin by opening the Find My app on the iPhone. There, select the MacBook from the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max devices section. On the following screen, scroll to the last option, “Erase This Device.”</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/10/change-apple-id-on-mac-5.jpg"                      alt="tap on erase this device"                ></p><ul><li>**Step 2:**Here, select “Continue” to confirm your choice, and follow on-screen instructions to erase the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device.

It’s essential to resolve this matter promptly. The reason is that many essential procedures and services are directly linked to your Apple ID. Here are some common reasons why you might face difficulty logging out of the old Apple ID and their solutions:</p><h3 id="1-Ongoing-iCloud-Backup"><a href="#1-Ongoing-iCloud-Backup" class="headerlink" title="1. Ongoing iCloud Backup"></a>1. Ongoing iCloud Backup</h3><p>While the data is backed up on the iCloud from your Mac, you cannot log out from the Apple ID. It is because, while the data is being uploaded, logging out of Apple ID is restricted to ensure that data is not lost during the process.</p><h4 id="Solution"><a href="#Solution" class="headerlink" title="Solution"></a>Solution</h4><p>Wait for the iCloud backup to complete before attempting to log out. You can access the backup information through “iCloud” within your Apple ID settings of System Settings. Here, tap “iCloud Drive” and stop syncing to stop the ongoing iCloud backup process.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/10/change-apple-id-on-mac-7.jpg"                      alt="stop icloud backup process"                ></p><h3 id="2-Bug-in-macOS"><a href="#2-Bug-in-macOS" class="headerlink" title="2.

These issues can usually be resolved with software updates or troubleshooting steps.</p><h4 id="Solution-1"><a href="#Solution-1" class="headerlink" title="Solution"></a>Solution</h4><p>To resolve the bugs and glitches within the MacBook, the best option is to update macOS to its latest version. For that, access “System Settings” through Dock and move to the “General” tab. Here, select “<a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/iphone-data-recovery/recover-lost-date-after-ios-17-update.html"><u>Software Update</u></a>“ to verify if an update is available and if an update is available, use “Update Now” to update the macOS.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/10/change-apple-id-on-mac-8.jpg"                      alt="press the update now button"                ></p><h3 id="3-Apple-Server-Inactivity"><a href="#3-Apple-Server-Inactivity" class="headerlink" title="3.

It’s recommended to visit Apple’s System Status page to ascertain the presence of any ongoing server issues.</p><h4 id="Solution-2"><a href="#Solution-2" class="headerlink" title="Solution"></a>Solution</h4><p>You will need to check the official Apple System Status page at <a href="https://www.apple.com/support/systemstatus/"><u>https://www.apple.com/support/systemstatus/</u></a>. Here, you can find out if the problem behind your inability to log out lies with the Apple servers.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/10/change-apple-id-on-mac-9.jpg"                      alt="check the apple server status"                ></p><p><a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/how-to-sign-out-of-apple-id-without-password.html"><u>Forgetting a password to your Apple ID</u></a> is a nightmare for Apple users.

Due to this, they have added multiple security features, including two-factor authentication. Thus, if you create an Apple ID, you can see a two-factor authentication option that adds an extra layer of security.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/10/remove-two-factor-authentication-1.jpg"                      alt="what is two factor authentication"                ></p><p>2FA is activated when the user provides the password to log into the Apple ID or software through a new device, and it acts as a second layer for account security. Apple ID or any software containing sensitive data cannot be accessed without it. This method provides a higher security level than single-factor authentication. To understand more benefits of this security system in detail, check the following points:</p><ol><li><strong>Protection From Password Theft:</strong> 2FA acts as an additional security level. It protects your accounts and devices in case your password is leaked.</li><li><strong>Migrations of Unauthorized Assets:</strong> Online banking applications use 2FA to protect users from unauthorized bank transfers. If someone accesses their app, this is a beneficial security measure.</li><li><strong>Protection on Multiple Services:</strong> Platforms, including social media, banks, and cloud storage, use 2FA. It means that 2FA can be used in various digital aspects.</li></ol><h2 id="Part-2-Can-You-Remove-the-Two-Factor-Authentication-iCloud-at-Anytime"><a href="#Part-2-Can-You-Remove-the-Two-Factor-Authentication-iCloud-at-Anytime" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Can You Remove the Two Factor Authentication iCloud at Anytime"></a>Part 2: Can You Remove the Two Factor Authentication iCloud at Anytime</h2><p>Many people use 2FA globally to protect their personal information and devices from hackers and unauthorized access. However, in some cases, users may want to <strong>remove two-factor authentication iCloud</strong> for multiple reasons. This includes scenarios in which their device is lost or damaged or if they have found a better security option than this one.</p><p>Moreover, there is one important key point to note: Apple has removed the feature of deactivating 2FA from the Apple ID. It means you need to think twice before activating this feature on your Apple ID because it cannot be reversed. For the following reasons, Apple has taken this initiative:</p><ol><li><strong>Enhanced Security:</strong> By removing the deactivation option for 2FA, Apple is trying to strengthen its account security to ensure that no one can access its user’s data.</li><li><strong>Reducing Vulnerabilities:</strong> Allowing users to deactivate 2FA could cause vulnerabilities in the Apple ecosystem that can be a weak point for protecting users’ data. That is why Apple has removed the deactivation option to stop malicious actors from taking advantage of this vulnerability.</li><li><strong>Encouraging Security Awareness:</strong> To make Apple users more security conscious, Apple has made it difficult on purpose to remove 2FA. It helps users to be more confident in Apple services and products.</li><li><strong>Minimizing Mistakenly Steps:</strong> If users mistakenly remove the 2FA, their accounts and devices are at risk of being accessed without proper authentication. To avoid such an issue, the deactivation option of 2FA is removed.</li></ol><p>Besides all these reasons, there is still some good news for those who want to <strong>remove the two-factor authentication iPhone</strong> to use other security options. The good news is that Apple allows users to remove 2FA for a limited time after activation.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-To-Remove-the-Two-Factor-Authentication-Within-14-Days"><a href="#Part-3-How-To-Remove-the-Two-Factor-Authentication-Within-14-Days" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How To Remove the Two-Factor Authentication Within 14 Days"></a>Part 3: How To Remove the Two-Factor Authentication Within 14 Days</h2><p>As explained in the last part, Apple has made removing the 2FA option from Apple ID challenging for several security reasons. Thus, if you want to remove 2FA from your Apple ID, you have only 14 days after activating this feature. To understand <strong>how to disable iCloud two-factor authentication</strong> within this given time, check the following steps:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1.</strong> Once you have activated the 2FA feature, your 14-day grace period will start eventually. To deactivate this, open the enrollment email you received from Apple regarding 2FA on your Apple ID.</li><li><strong>Step 2.</strong> Scroll to the bottom of this email and select the link or button to return to your account security &amp; settings section. There, follow the on-screen instructions to deactivate the 2FA of your Apple ID.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/10/remove-two-factor-authentication-2.jpg"                      alt="deactivate two factor authentication"                ></p><h2 id="Part-4-iPhone-Apple-ID-Got-Locked-Here’s-a-Reliable-Tool-To-Get-It-Unlocked-Without-Passcode"><a href="#Part-4-iPhone-Apple-ID-Got-Locked-Here’s-a-Reliable-Tool-To-Get-It-Unlocked-Without-Passcode" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: iPhone Apple ID Got Locked?

It works even if the Find My&#x2F;Find My iPhone feature is active on the Apple iPhone 15 Pro device. This tool helps restore access to all your iCloud services and Apple ID features by signing in with a new account. Following are the steps to remove the Apple ID from your iOS Device:</p><p><strong>Step 1: Access Remove Apple ID in Wondershare Dr.Fone</strong></p><p>To begin, open Wondershare Dr.Fone on your computer. Then, navigate to “Toolbox,” tap “Screen Unlock,” and define “iOS” as the Apple iPhone 15 Pro device type. It will give you access to the iOS screen unlock menu, where you need to choose “Remove Apple ID.” Now, you need to connect your iDevice to the computer.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/remove-apple-id-1.png"                      alt="tap on remove apple id feature"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2: Enable Lock Screen and 2FA</strong></p><p>When your iDevice is connected to your computer, you’ll notice a connectivity status displayed on the following screen. Proceed by clicking the “Unlock Now” button. Dr.Fone will now ask if you have the screen lock and 2FA enabled on your device. The answer to these questions needs to be affirmative, and if you don’t have the option enabled, you will need to do it before proceeding.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/remove-apple-id-2.png"                      alt="press the unlock now button"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3: Enable Recovery Mode on Your iOS Device</strong></p><p>Once you’ve confirmed these options, you’ll be directed to a screen that presents on-screen guidelines for placing your iDevice in Recovery Mode. Adhere to the instructions that correspond to your specific iOS model. After initiating Recovery Mode on the Apple iPhone 15 Pro device, the subsequent screen will present its details.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/remove-apple-id-5.png"                      alt="enable the iphone recovery mode"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4: Complete the Apple ID Removal Process</strong></p><p>Upon the identification of the Apple iPhone 15 Pro device Model, you will simply be prompted to choose the “System Version” and initiate the process by clicking on “Start.” Now, wait for the firmware to download, and once it is downloaded, click “Unlock Now.” A confirmation window promptly emerges on the screen, prompting you to input a code for further progress.

If you don’t remember the security questions, you can also reset the recovery password using the registered e-mail ID.</p><p>Follow these instructions to reset your password and then sign out of the Apple ID.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Go to the <a class="link"   href="https://appleid.apple.com/" >Apple ID Account Page <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and click “<strong>Forgot Apple ID or Password</strong>”.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2020/05/forgot-apple-id-or-password.jpg"                      alt="forgot apple id or password"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Enter your Apple ID and click “<strong>Continue</strong>”.

This method will only work if you remember all the answers to every security question. Once you select this method, you’ll be prompted to a new window, with all security questions. Answer these questions and follow the further instructions to reset your password.</p></li><li><p>If you’ve added a recovery e-mail while creating your Apple ID, you can also use it to reset the password.

Let’s explore the common reasons you might encounter this issue:</p><h3 id="Wrong-Password-Input"><a href="#Wrong-Password-Input" class="headerlink" title="Wrong Password Input"></a>Wrong Password Input</h3><p>One of the most straightforward reasons for a failed verification is entering the wrong password. This could be a simple typing error or misremembering your password. Repeated wrong attempts can also lead to your account being temporarily disabled as a security measure.</p><h3 id="Apple-Server-Issues"><a href="#Apple-Server-Issues" class="headerlink" title="Apple Server Issues"></a>Apple Server Issues</h3><p>At times, the problem may not be on your end. Apple’s servers can experience downtime or technical glitches like any other online service. During such instances, verification processes might fail, as the server cannot authenticate your credentials.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/apple-id-verification-not-working-02.jpg"                      alt="apple server status page"                ></p><h3 id="Slow-Internet-or-Intermittent-Connection"><a href="#Slow-Internet-or-Intermittent-Connection" class="headerlink" title="Slow Internet or Intermittent Connection"></a>Slow Internet or Intermittent Connection</h3><p>A stable and reliable internet connection is improtant for the verification process.

However, it can also be a source of problems. If there’s a delay in receiving the 2FA code or if <a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/android-issue/authentication-error.html"><u>2FA fails to work</u></a>, you won’t be able to complete the verification process. This could be due to network issues or, sometimes, glitches within the 2FA system itself.</p><h3 id="Suspicious-Activity"><a href="#Suspicious-Activity" class="headerlink" title="Suspicious Activity"></a>Suspicious Activity</h3><p>Apple takes your security seriously. If there’s any unusual activity detected on your account, such as login attempts from unfamiliar locations or devices, Apple might lock your account as a precaution. This can trigger the verification failed prompt as the system seeks to protect your account from potential unauthorized access.</p><p>By understanding these scenarios, you can diagnose better why you’re facing the issue of <strong>Apple verification ID not working</strong>.

This starts with the quality of hardware and the synergy with the software that runs the hardware, and the user experience you get. Apple puts great emphasis on this, and rightly so, for this is one of the keys defining and differentiating factors for people to choose Apple’s iOS over Google’s Android. Like with all good things in life, sometimes, a spanner is put in the works that bring your smooth-sailing life to an abrupt halt. With smartphones playing pivotal roles in our lives today, from payments to internet experiences to getting work done to stay in touch with people, anything that stops us from using our smartphone or endangers that experience is a cause for worry. A locked Apple ID is one such thing. It does not happen frequently, in fact, most users will never experience a locked Apple ID, but for the ones who are fortunate enough to have such a rare experience in life, help is at hand. All you need to do is relax and read on. By the end of it, you will have an unlocked Apple ID and you can go back to cruising.</p><h2 id="Part-I-Difference-Between-Activation-Lock-and-Locked-Apple-ID"><a href="#Part-I-Difference-Between-Activation-Lock-and-Locked-Apple-ID" class="headerlink" title="Part I: Difference Between Activation Lock and Locked Apple ID"></a>Part I: Difference Between Activation Lock and Locked Apple ID</h2><p>Apple being Apple, does a lot to make sure that users get the smoothest experience possible when interacting with their Apple products, both hardware, and software. Yet, sometimes, the messaging gets confusing, and people are not sure what is what. One such thing is the difference between iCloud Activation Lock and Apple ID Lock. While people are more likely to encounter Activation Lock and less likely to encounter Apple ID Lock, they are often confused when they encounter Apple ID Lock and struggle to figure out what that means and how to resolve the issue.</p><p>Activation Lock is when your supported Apple device is locked for a number of reasons. The most common reason is a stolen device that was locked by its owner, however, there are other perfectly valid reasons such as an outgoing employee forgetting to sign out and erase their Apple device before submitting it back. The IT department would not be able to reset that device without turning off Find My Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max and Activation Lock on the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device.</p><p>A locked Apple ID usually happens when the user has forgotten their password to their Apple ID account and attempts to figure out the password have been unsuccessful. Sometimes, Apple ID gets locked automatically under some conditions, and that requires users to reset their password to gain access. A locked Apple ID does not mean that your device is locked for your use. You can keep using it so long as you do not try to use another Apple ID with it since to do that you would have to sign out of your current Apple ID (which is locked) and you won’t be able to do that. On the other hand, Activation Lock renders the entire device unusable till the lock is cleared.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/10/unlock-apple-id-on-iphone-13-3.jpg"                      alt="apple id locked message"                ></p><p>In short, Apple ID Lock is about a user’s account with Apple, akin to how Google Account works on Android devices. Apple ID Lock locks a user’s account with Apple while retaining complete usage of the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device whereas Activation Lock locks the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device and prevents anyone from using it until the correct credentials are entered. This is about verifying the ownership of the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device and works to deter theft of Apple devices.</p><h2 id="Part-II-Checking-If-Your-Apple-ID-Is-Locked"><a href="#Part-II-Checking-If-Your-Apple-ID-Is-Locked" class="headerlink" title="Part II: Checking If Your Apple ID Is Locked"></a>Part II: Checking If Your Apple ID Is Locked</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/10/unlock-apple-id-on-iphone-13-4.jpg"                      alt="the message of apple id locked"                ></p><p>A locked Apple ID is rather unmistakable. Your device would keep telling you that your Apple ID is locked for your security. Your Apple ID could be locked or disabled altogether if someone has tried to gain access to your account (and, obviously, failed). Apple would disable access to the Apple ID unless you are able to prove rightful ownership and reset the password successfully.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2144277/7443" target="_top" id="2144277">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2144277" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="600" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2144277/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-III-Reasons-for-Locked-Apple-ID"><a href="#Part-III-Reasons-for-Locked-Apple-ID" class="headerlink" title="Part III: Reasons for Locked Apple ID"></a>Part III: Reasons for Locked Apple ID</h2><p>There can be a few reasons why your Apple ID is locked. You forgot the password and now it is locked since you entered the wrong password too many times. A scarier prospect, albeit a real one, is that some malicious actor attempted to login into your Apple ID account but failed. Had they succeeded, you would have gotten a message that ‘your Apple ID is being used on another device’ now.</p><p>Apple does a lot to ensure that your Apple ID remains safe. You trust Apple with a lot of your data, including financial data by way of your credit cards associated with Apple ID to make purchases on the App Store and iTunes Store. Therefore, some of the time, Apple preempts issues by proactively locking up your Apple ID or even disabling it. It goes without saying that sometimes it is something so simple as a software error that is believed to have locked up Apple IDs for many users around the world a while ago. It is also entirely possible that it was some malicious actor probing the servers for accounts.</p><p>All of these will result in a locked Apple ID that users will have to reset their password to in order to gain access back.</p><h2 id="Part-IV-How-to-Unlock-Apple-ID-on-Apple-iPhone-15-Pro-Max"><a href="#Part-IV-How-to-Unlock-Apple-ID-on-Apple-iPhone-15-Pro-Max" class="headerlink" title="Part IV: How to Unlock Apple ID on Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max"></a>Part IV: How to Unlock Apple ID on Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/10/unlock-apple-id-on-iphone-13-1.jpg"                      alt="apple id webpage"                ></p><p>It is unfortunate you are facing a locked Apple ID. Apple tries its best to make users aware of safety protocols they need to follow to minimize and mitigate such unfortunate occurrences, such as using two-factor authentication, trusted devices, trusted phone numbers, passwords, passcodes, etc. that serve as deterrents to prevent unauthorized access to devices and accounts. Yet, when the unfortunate happens, what to do?</p><h3 id="IV-I-Unlock-Apple-ID-Via-Two-Factor-Authentication"><a href="#IV-I-Unlock-Apple-ID-Via-Two-Factor-Authentication" class="headerlink" title="IV.I: Unlock Apple ID Via Two-Factor Authentication"></a>IV.I: Unlock Apple ID Via Two-Factor Authentication</h3><p>Apple implemented two-factor authentication a long time ago to prevent unauthorized access to Apple ID accounts.

It will save you the trouble of managing two different IDs with multiple accounts associated with each one.</li><li><strong>Shared Apple ID:</strong> It is possible that you were sharing your account with your partner or another family member and now want to get your own account.

There are scenarios where some adjustments may be necessary and some may not. For instance, in the case of purchasing a used MacBook, it’s conceivable that the prior owner’s Apple ID could still be linked to the Apple iPhone 15 Pro device.</p><p>In such instances, you’ll need to contact the previous owner and request them to disassociate their Apple ID. Here are two practical methods for <strong>how to change Apple ID on MacBook Air</strong>:</p><h3 id="Way-1-Using-the-iPhone"><a href="#Way-1-Using-the-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Way 1: Using the iPhone"></a>Way 1: Using the iPhone</h3><p>The first way the previous owner can remove the Apple ID from your MacBook is by using his iPhone. You can ask the previous owner to follow these steps on their iPhone:</p><ul><li>**Step 1:**Start the process by accessing the Settings app on your Apple iPhone 15 Pro.

The steps for removing Apple ID using the Find My app are given below:</p><ul><li>**Step 1:**Begin by opening the Find My app on the iPhone. There, select the MacBook from the Apple iPhone 15 Pro devices section. On the following screen, scroll to the last option, “Erase This Device.”</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/10/change-apple-id-on-mac-5.jpg"                      alt="tap on erase this device"                ></p><ul><li>**Step 2:**Here, select “Continue” to confirm your choice, and follow on-screen instructions to erase the Apple iPhone 15 Pro device.

It’s essential to resolve this matter promptly. The reason is that many essential procedures and services are directly linked to your Apple ID. Here are some common reasons why you might face difficulty logging out of the old Apple ID and their solutions:</p><h3 id="1-Ongoing-iCloud-Backup"><a href="#1-Ongoing-iCloud-Backup" class="headerlink" title="1. Ongoing iCloud Backup"></a>1. Ongoing iCloud Backup</h3><p>While the data is backed up on the iCloud from your Mac, you cannot log out from the Apple ID. It is because, while the data is being uploaded, logging out of Apple ID is restricted to ensure that data is not lost during the process.</p><h4 id="Solution"><a href="#Solution" class="headerlink" title="Solution"></a>Solution</h4><p>Wait for the iCloud backup to complete before attempting to log out. You can access the backup information through “iCloud” within your Apple ID settings of System Settings. Here, tap “iCloud Drive” and stop syncing to stop the ongoing iCloud backup process.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/10/change-apple-id-on-mac-7.jpg"                      alt="stop icloud backup process"                ></p><h3 id="2-Bug-in-macOS"><a href="#2-Bug-in-macOS" class="headerlink" title="2.

These issues can usually be resolved with software updates or troubleshooting steps.</p><h4 id="Solution-1"><a href="#Solution-1" class="headerlink" title="Solution"></a>Solution</h4><p>To resolve the bugs and glitches within the MacBook, the best option is to update macOS to its latest version. For that, access “System Settings” through Dock and move to the “General” tab. Here, select “<a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/iphone-data-recovery/recover-lost-date-after-ios-17-update.html"><u>Software Update</u></a>“ to verify if an update is available and if an update is available, use “Update Now” to update the macOS.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/10/change-apple-id-on-mac-8.jpg"                      alt="press the update now button"                ></p><h3 id="3-Apple-Server-Inactivity"><a href="#3-Apple-Server-Inactivity" class="headerlink" title="3.

It’s recommended to visit Apple’s System Status page to ascertain the presence of any ongoing server issues.</p><h4 id="Solution-2"><a href="#Solution-2" class="headerlink" title="Solution"></a>Solution</h4><p>You will need to check the official Apple System Status page at <a href="https://www.apple.com/support/systemstatus/"><u>https://www.apple.com/support/systemstatus/</u></a>. Here, you can find out if the problem behind your inability to log out lies with the Apple servers.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/10/change-apple-id-on-mac-9.jpg"                      alt="check the apple server status"                ></p><p><a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/how-to-sign-out-of-apple-id-without-password.html"><u>Forgetting a password to your Apple ID</u></a> is a nightmare for Apple users.

They have developed an impressive, interconnected model that helps the user keep the data intact across the Apple iPhone 15 Pro device. With unique identification protocols to keep the Apple iPhone 15 Pro device safe from illegal access, Apple provides its user with its own cloud backup platform. iCloud offers Apple users a unique platform with the ability to synchronize and back their data up. This helps the users keep a duplicate in places where they accidentally lose their important data. However, if you have stopped using an Apple device that had an activated iCloud backup system, you may find it necessary to remove the Apple iPhone 15 Pro device from the iCloud account. For such cases, there are a few techniques that can be adapted to cater to the issue at hand. This article introduces and provides you a detailed guide on how to remove a device from iCloud through the implementation of straightforward and notable techniques.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2020/11/remove-device-from-icloud.jpg"                      alt="remove device from icloud"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-happens-if-I-remove-a-device-from-my-iCloud"><a href="#Part-1-What-happens-if-I-remove-a-device-from-my-iCloud" class="headerlink" title="Part 1.

What happens if I remove a device from my iCloud?</h2><p>If you look over the operation of iCloud service for any Apple device, the exemption of the service will lead you into losing access from a service that offers you a backing up feature along with synchronization. Furthermore, this will also affect the Find My service, leading you to make your device theft evasive. The removal of the Find My service makes it possible for thieves to wipe off data of the Apple iPhone 15 Pro device and have it sold across the market, with no chances of retrieval. Despite the removal of the iCloud service from your device, it will function normally; however, the security and tranquility offered by the Apple iPhone 15 Pro device would not remain intact with its exemption. The iCloud account that has been removed will keep the data that has been previously stored in it by the Apple iPhone 15 Pro device backup, but it would not accept any new addition.</p><p>Whenever you consider removing the iCloud backup from the Apple iPhone 15 Pro device, it prompts over keeping the data on your device, if necessary.

Apple devices are considered among the most secure in the tech industry. Moreover, Apple takes device security seriously. An example is the use of security questions.</p><p>When you create an Apple ID or set up a new device, Apple prompts you to choose security questions. These questions are carefully designed to be something only you would know. This explains their role as an extra layer of protection for your account. Typical instances include questions like “What is the name of your first pet?” or “In which city were you born?”</p><h3 id="Importance-of-Apple-ID-Security-Questions"><a href="#Importance-of-Apple-ID-Security-Questions" class="headerlink" title="Importance of Apple ID Security Questions"></a>Importance of Apple ID Security Questions</h3><p>The security questions associated with your Apple ID serve a critical role.
